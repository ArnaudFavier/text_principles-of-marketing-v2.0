    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p01">Managing all of a company’s offerings presents a number of challenges. Depending on the size of the company and the breadth of the company’s offerings, several positions may be needed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p02">A brand manager is one such position. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand manager</a><span class="glossdef">A person responsible for all business decisions regarding offerings within one brand. A brand manager is often charged with running his or her brand as if it is its own separate business.</span></span> is the person responsible for all business decisions regarding offerings within one brand. By business decisions, we mean making decisions that affect profit and loss, which include such decisions as which offerings to include in the brand, how to position the brand in the market, pricing options, and so forth. Indeed, a brand manager is often charged with running the brand as if it were its own separate business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p03">A brand manager is much more likely to be found in consumer marketing companies. Typically, B2B companies do not have multiple brands so the position is not common in the B2B environment. What you often find in a B2B company is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product manager</a><span class="glossdef">Someone with business responsibility for a particular product or product line. Like brand managers, product managers must make decisions, such as which offerings to include, advertising selection, and others.</span></span>, someone with business responsibility for a particular product or product line. Like the brand manager, the product manager must make many business decisions, such as which offerings to include, advertising selection, and so on. Companies with brand managers include Microsoft, Procter &amp; Gamble, SC Johnson, Kraft, Target, General Mills, and ConAgra Foods. Product managers are found at Xerox, IBM, Konica-Minolta Business Solutions, Rockwell International, and many others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p04">The University of Georgia was the first to launch a graduate program in brand management, but the only major program now being taught in the United States is at the University of Wisconsin. The program is managed through the university’s Center for Brand and Product Management. Most brand managers simply have an undergraduate degree in marketing, but it helps to have a strong background in either finance or accounting because of the profitability and volume decisions brand managers have to make. In the United Kingdom, a number of school have undergraduate degree programs specializing in brand management, as does Seneca College in Toronto, Canada.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p05">In some companies, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">category manager</a><span class="glossdef">Someone responsible for managing a broad group of products that may belong to multiple manufacturers.</span></span> has responsibility for business decisions within a broad grouping of offerings. For example, a category manager at SC Johnson may have all home cleaning products, which would mean that brands such as Pledge, Vanish, Drano, Fantastik, Windex, Scrubbing Bubbles, and Shout would be that person’s responsibility. Each of those brands may be managed by brand manager who then reports directly to the category manager.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p06">At the retail level, a category manager at each store is responsible for more than just one manufacturer’s products. The home cleaning category manager would have responsibility for offerings from SC Johnson, as well as Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and many other producers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p07">Another option is to create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market manager</a><span class="glossdef">Someone responsible for managing efforts within a particular market, such as a geographic market or another grouping of customers into a market (e.g., a single industry or size).</span></span>, who is responsible for business decisions within a market. In this case, a market can be defined as a geographic market or region; a market segment, such as a type of business; or a channel of distribution. For example, SC Johnson could have regional insect control managers. Regional market managers would make sense for insect control because weather has an influence on which bugs are pests at any given time. For example, a southern regional manager would want more inventory of the repellent Off! in March because it is already warm and the mosquitoes are already breeding and biting in the southern United States.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p08">In B2B markets, a market manager is more likely to be given responsibility for a particular market segment, such as all hospital health care professionals or doctor’s offices. All customers such as these (retail, wholesale, and so forth) in a particular industry compose what’s called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vertical market</a><span class="glossdef">B2B customers that compose a particular industry, such as the health care industry.</span></span>, and the managers of these markets are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vertical market managers</a><span class="glossdef">Marketing managers who oversee B2B products sold to a particular industry.</span></span>. B2B companies organize in this way because</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_l02">
        <li>buying needs and processes are likely to be similar within an industry,</li>
        <li>channels of communication are likely to be the same within an industry but different across industries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p09">Because magazines, Web sites, and trade shows are organized to serve specific industries or even specific positions within industries, B2B marketers find vertical market structures for marketing departments to be more efficient than organizing by geography.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p10">Market managers sometimes report to brand managers or are a part of their firms’ sales organizations and report to sales executives. Market managers are less likely to have as much flexibility in terms of pricing and product decisions and have no control over the communication content of marketing campaigns or marketing strategies. These managers are more likely to be tasked with implementing a product or brand manager’s strategy and be responsible for their markets. Some companies have market managers but no brand managers. Instead, marketing vice presidents or other executives are responsible for the brands.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s05_p11">Brand managers decide what products are to be marketed and how. Other important positions include category managers, market managers, and vertical market managers. Category managers are found in consumer markets, usually in retail. Market managers can be found in both consumer markets and B2B markets. However, vertical market managers are found only in B2B markets. Some companies have market managers but no brand managers. Instead, a vice president of marketing or other executive is responsible for the brands.</p>
