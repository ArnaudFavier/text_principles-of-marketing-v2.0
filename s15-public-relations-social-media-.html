    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_p01">You just finished reading a great newspaper story about a local restaurant even though you know the company has experienced several lawsuits and many customer complaints. The news story makes the restaurant sound like a great corporate citizen and the best place to eat in town. Sometimes a company gets “free” <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">publicity</a><span class="glossdef">Publicized information such as news stories about products and services, people, and organizations.</span></span> such as news stories or reviews about its products and services in the mass media, even though the organization has no control over the content of the stories and might not even know about their publication. How did a restaurant with so many complaints manage to get such a great story written about it? How did it get good coverage when it might not be deserved? Perhaps the restaurant used part of its promotion budget to pay for public relations efforts to generate positive stories and positive publicity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Public relations (PR)</a><span class="glossdef">The process of creating a positive image for a company, an offering, or a person via publicity.</span></span> includes information that an organization wants its public (customers, employees, stakeholders, general public) to know. PR involves creating a positive image for a company, an offering, or a person via publicity. PR has become more important in recent years because there are now so many media outlets people pay attention to, including YouTube, social networking sites, and blogs. It’s pretty easy for anyone to say anything about a company in public forum. Indeed, publicity is a double-edged sword; it can result in negative news, such as a poor review of a movie, restaurant, or car, or positive news. Organizations work hard to get favorable news stories, so while publicity sounds free, building relationships with journalists does cost money. Just like advertising, public relations, sponsorships, and social media are critical components of the promotion mix and promotion budget for many firms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e616.fwk-133234-ch12_p99">Sponsorships (the financial support of different events, buildings, and activities) often create a lot of publicity. As such, more organizations are realizing the benefit of allocating part of their promotion budget to sponsorships. While most people associate sponsorships with sports, companies also sponsor things such as entertainment, buildings, events, and philanthropic projects, as well as brands and products on social media. Expenditures on sponsorships in North America are estimated to be about $18.9 billion in 2012.<span class="footnote" id="e616.fwk-tanner-fn12_085">Joe Mandese, “Sponsorship Loses Steam, but Continues to Outpace Ad Growth,” Normbondmarkets.com, January 12, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://normbondmarkets.com/sponsorship-loses-steam-but-continues-to-outpace-ad-growth/">http://normbondmarkets.com/sponsorship-loses-steam-but-continues-to-outpace-ad-growth/</a>.</span> While sports dominate the use of sponsorships, sponsorship of entertainment such as concerts and theme parks continues to grow. Social media sponsorship, which occurs when companies pay social media publishers to “talk” (write blogs or post updates) about things such as their brands, movies, products, or contests also continues to grow. Cash-sponsored social media providers are expected to exceed $65 million by 2014.<span class="footnote" id="e616.fwk-tanner-fn12_084">“Social Media Sponsorships,” Izea.com, accessed January 15, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://izea.com/advertisers/social-media-sponsorhips/">http://izea.com/advertisers/social-media-sponsorhips/</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_p03">Organizations also use texting and multimedia messages, including social media, to generate positive customer perceptions and sales as well as for recruiting and hiring. Social media includes methods of online communication among organizations, people, and communities. The social media environment is rapidly changing and continues to grow in popularity. Think about the different types of social media that you use.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e618.fwk-133234-ch12_p98">Facebook, a social media networking site, has 800 million users worldwide, which exceeds the populations of all countries in the world except China and India. While the United States has the most Facebook users with 155 million, India is second with 43.5 million. Facebook expects their popularity and growth to continue as they target over two billion Internet users worldwide.<span class="footnote" id="e618.fwk-tanner-fn12_083">Nyay Bhushan, “India Has World’s Second-Highest Number of Facebook Users at Over 43 Million,” <em class="emphasis">The Hollywood Reporter</em>, February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-has-worlds-second-highest-286904">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-has-worlds-second-highest-286904</a>.</span> Over half of Chinese, Korean, Indian, and Thai Internet users access social media sites through their phones rather than through computers.<span class="footnote" id="e618.fwk-tanner-fn12_079">“Social Network Site Users Ready to Go Mobile But Telecom Carriers Need to Set the Stage for Mass Adoption, Says IDC,” <em class="emphasis">IDC</em>, November 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.idc.com/AP/pressrelease.jsp?containerId=prSG22084309">http://www.idc.com/AP/pressrelease.jsp?containerId=prSG22084309</a> (accessed January 20, 2010).</span> In this chapter, we examine the public relations, social media, and sponsorship  tools  organizations use and how they contribute to a company’s success.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p01">Good public relations efforts can help a firm create rapport with its customers, promote what it has to offer, and supplement its sales efforts. PR puts a positive spin on news stories and is often perceived as more neutral and objective than other forms of promotion because much of the information is tailored to sound as if it has been created by an organization independent of the seller. Public relations materials include press releases, publicity, and news conferences. Companies also use PR to promote products and to supplement their sales efforts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p02">Many organizations that engage in public relations have in-house PR departments, media relations groups, or investor relations groups. Other organizations sometimes hire external PR firms or advertising agencies to find and create public relations opportunities for them. PR specialists must build relationships with people at different media outlets to help get their stories placed. Universities, hospitals, government organizations, and charitable organizations often hire PR people to help disseminate positive information about their services and to increase interest in what they do. As such, PR is part of a company’s promotion budget and their integrated marketing communications.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e758.fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p02">PR specialists also help political campaign managers generate positive information in the press. PR specialists can handle crisis communication and put a positive view on situations when something bad happens to an organization or person. In foreign markets, PR agencies may help ensure product concepts are understood correctly. Getting all PR stories placed in desired media is not guaranteed. A lot of time and effort is spent getting to know people who can help publish or announce the information to the public.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p03">Companies use a variety of tools for their public relations purposes, including annual reports, brochures and magazines for both employees and the public, Web sites to show good things they’re doing, speeches, blogs, and podcasts. Some of the most commonly used PR tools include press releases, news conferences, and publicity. Sponsorships, product placements, and social media also generate a lot of positive PR.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Press Releases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Part of a company’s public relations efforts includes putting a positive spin on news stories. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">press release</a><span class="glossdef">A news story written by an organization to promote a product, service, or person.</span></span> is a news story written by an organization to promote a product, organization, or person. Consider how much better a story or a product recommendation is likely to be perceived when the receiver thinks the content is from an objective third party rather than an organization writing about itself. Public relations personnel frequently prepare press releases in hopes that the news media will pick them up and disseminate the information to the public. However, there is no guarantee that the media will use a press release. Some of the PR opportunities that companies may seek to highlight in their press releases include charity events, awards, new products, company reports, and things they are doing to improve the environment or local community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Read the following two examples of press releases. The first story sounds like it was written by a news organization, but it was created by Apple and their public relations people to highlight the introduction of the new iPhone 3G. The second press release and picture (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_f01">Figure 12.1 "A Picture of Stubb’s Legendary Kitchen’s “Feed the World Tour”"</a>) provide an example of how a company like Stubb’s Bar-B-Q teams up with Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes, a charity that helps feed the hungry, to help feed homeless and poor people and restock food banks around the country. The story enhances the positive image of both organizations.</p>

The Austin-based company chose Mobile Loaves as its partner to kick off the “Feed the World Tour,” which is named for the stated mission of Texas Bar-B-Q legend, C.B. “Stubb” Stubblefield, who said: “I was born hungry I want to feed the world.”</p>

Domino’s Pizza was forced to engage in damage control after two of its employees created a video doing disgusting things to pizzas and then posting it to YouTube. If the publicity is particularly bad, as it was for Domino’s, a company might hold a press conference or prepare a speech for the top executive to give. For example, the president of Domino’s spoke on video to try to control the damage to Domino’s business. The company then posted the following video on YouTube.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p15">Similarly, companies that move into foreign markets are sometimes perceived negatively by locals because they have little information about the firms. In India, the reputation of companies is very important to workers and their families. As a result, U.S. employers recruiting in the tech industry in India often have to work hard to make their brands and products known so people will want to work for them. The firms do so via various PR efforts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p16">Just as press releases can be used to promote the good things an organization or person does, press conferences can also be held when a company is simply seeking good PR. An organization might hold a press conference to announce that it has hired new, highly sought-after executives, that it is breaking ground on a new building, or to talk about its community service projects.</p>

Worldwide, corporations spent over $43 billion on sponsorships in 2008;<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn12_004">“Events and Sponsorship 2008 Marketing Fact Book,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing News</em>, July 15, 2008, 26.</span> however, the recession has taken a toll and the new stadium for the Dallas Cowboys still doesn’t have a sponsor with naming rights. Over two-thirds of the sponsorships in North America are for sports, followed by entertainment (e.g., music and performing arts) and causes (e.g., the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and “alternative spring breaks” for college students). Other organizations and structures, such as buildings and bridges, may seek sponsorships as a means of generating revenue. Imagine how many people drive across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York or the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and how much awareness an organization would get if they were allowed to pay to have their name on either of the bridges.</p>

It occurs when a company supports a nonprofit organization in some way. For example, M&amp;M’s sponsors the Special Olympics and American Airlines raises money for breast cancer research with an annual celebrity golf and tennis tournament. The airline also donates frequent flier miles to the cause. Yoplait Yogurt donates money for breast cancer research for every pink lid that is submitted. Cause-related marketing can have a positive PR impact by strengthening the affinity people have for a company that does it.</p>

The number of product placements is expected to increase as consumers continue to skip commercials and advertisements using digital video recorders (DVRs).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s02_p01">Social media uses technology and mobility to provide an interactive means of communication among people, organizations, and communities who are interconnected and interdependent. Many channels and vehicles are available for social media just as there are many different television shows and magazines. With changing technology, new vehicles are added frequently.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s02_p02">With over half of Americans participating in social networks, people and organizations who don’t participate may be at a disadvantage with some groups in society. Not only does the majority of the population in the United States have a profile on a social network, but at least one-third of those people access the sites multiple times a day. Not only is social media popular for keeping in touch with friends, but companies use social media to promote their brands and as a tool for recruiting and hiring. People follow companies and brands on social media, especially on Facebook, whereas LinkedIn generates more job referrals. Just as companies are allocating more of their promotion budget to social media, they are also increasing their expenditures on social recruiting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s02_p03">Social media is complex and rapidly changing. While there is some overlap between personal and business, one way to improve the understanding of social media is to think about social media zones. Social media zones include social communities, social publishing, social entertainment, and social commerce. Think about the different ways you use social media and which zones you utilize. You probably use all of the zones.</p>

Think about your profile. Whatever you type becomes a digital version of you. In social communities, you communicate and socialize with others. While you may share information with others, you must be careful how much and what information you choose to post.</p>

Think about videos you may have posted. When companies pay to have product reviews posted or to promote contests or their brands, they may use social publishers to write blogs and generate word of mouth. Many companies are also posting their own commercials and other content on YouTube.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s02_p07">Do you remember talking about e-commerce? Well, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social commerce zone</a><span class="glossdef">Websites that provide a means for interactive shopping.</span></span> is part of e-commerce where people buy and sell products on the Internet. Social commerce provides a means for interactive shopping, including reviews, ratings, and social shopping Web sites where you can chat with merchant personnel or with friends while you are shopping.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s02_p08">While organizations are allocating more of their promotion budgets to social media, they are also generating a lot of buzz or talk without a lot of expense. To see the impact social media has, consider the buzz created by Old Milwaukee’s commercial shown during Super Bowl XLVI, which only aired locally in North Platte, Nebraska. North Platte is the second smallest television market in the country with only 15,000 homes but it is hometown to New England Patriots Danny Woodhead, While the thirty-second spot only targeted a small audience at a cost of $700–$1500 in the local market (compared to $3.5 million for national thirty-second spot), the commercial created more buzz than many of the nationally broadcast commercials.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn12_082">Felix Gillette, "Did Will Ferrell Win the Super Bowl?" <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, February 19, 2012, 27–28.</span> The YouTube version shown in the following video has been viewed over a million times, much more than the always popular Budweiser commercials.
