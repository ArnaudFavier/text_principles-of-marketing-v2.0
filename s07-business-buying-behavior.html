<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 4</span> Business Buying Behavior</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_p01">In the last chapter, we talked about the buying behavior of consumers—people like you and me who buy products for our own personal use. However, many businesses don’t offer their goods and services to individual consumers at all. Instead, their customers are other businesses, institutions, or government organizations. These are the business-to-business (B2B) markets we talked about in <a class="xref" href="fwk-133234-ch01#fwk-133234-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Marketing?"</a>.</p>

            <li>Identify the ways in which business-to-business (B2B) markets differ from business-to-consumer (B2C) markets.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p01">Business-to-business (B2B) markets differ from business-to-consumer (B2C) markets in many ways. For one, the number of products sold in business markets dwarfs the number sold in consumer markets. Suppose you buy a five-hundred-dollar computer from Dell. The sale amounts to a single transaction for you. But think of all the transactions Dell had to go through to sell you that one computer. Dell had to purchase many parts from many computer component makers. It also had to purchase equipment and facilities to assemble the computers, hire and pay employees, pay money to create and maintain its Web site and advertise, and buy insurance and accounting and financial services to keep its operations running smoothly. Many transactions had to happen before you could purchase your computer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e25.tanner_p-5254-20111102-150725-571205">Each of those transactions needed a salesperson. Each of those companies have a marketing department. Thus, there are a lot more college marketing graduates going into B2B companies than in B2C, which is reason enough to spend some time studying the subject. There are other differences, too.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p02">Business products can be very complex. Some need to be custom built or retrofitted for buyers. The products include everything from high-dollar construction equipment to commercial real estate and buildings, military equipment, and billion-dollar cruise liners used in the tourism industry. A single customer can account for a huge amount of business. Some businesses, like those that supply the U.S. auto industry around Detroit, have just a handful of customers—General Motors, Chrysler, and/or Ford. Consequently, you can imagine why these suppliers become very worried when the automakers fall on hard times.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p03">Not only can business products be complex, but so can figuring out the buying dynamics of organizations. Many people within an organization can be part of the buying process and have a say in ultimately what gets purchased, how much of it, and from whom. Having different people involved makes business marketing much more complicated. And because of the quantities each business customer is capable of buying, the stakes are high. For some organizations, losing a big account can be financially devastating and winning one can be a financial bonanza.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p04">How high are the stakes? <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch04_s01_t01">Table 4.1 "Top Five Corporations Worldwide in Terms of Their Revenues"</a> shows a recent ranking of the top five corporations in the world in terms of the sales they generate annually. Believe it or not, these companies earn more in a year than all the businesses of some countries do. Imagine the windfall you could gain as a seller by landing an exclusive account with any one of them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p05">Generally, the more high-dollar and complex the item being sold is, the longer it takes for the sale to be made. The sale of a new commercial jet to an airline company such as Southwest Airlines, Delta, or American Airlines can literally take years to be completed. Purchases such as these are risky for companies. The buyers are concerned about many factors, such as the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the planes. They also generally want the jets customized in some way. Consequently, a lot of time and effort is needed to close these deals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p06">Unlike many consumers, most business buyers demand that the products they buy meet strict standards. Take for example the Five Guys burger chain, based in Virginia. The company taste-tested eighteen different types of mayonnaise before settling on the one it uses. Would you be willing to taste eighteen different brands of mayonnaise before buying one? Probably not.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_001">Michael Steinberg, “A Fine Diner,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, November 21–22, 2009, 5.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_p07">Another characteristic of B2B markets is the level of personal selling that goes on. Salespeople personally call on business customers to a far greater extent than they do consumers. Most of us have had door-to-door salespeople call on us occasionally. However, businesses often have multiple salespeople call on them in person daily, and some customers even provide office space for key vendors’ salespeople. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch04_s01_t02">Table 4.2 "Business-to-Consumer Markets versus Business-to-Business Markets: How They Compare"</a> outlines the main differences between B2C and B2B markets.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Demand for B2B Products</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Even though they don’t sell their products to consumers like you and me, B2B sellers carefully watch general economic conditions to anticipate consumer buying patterns. The firms do so because the demand for business products is based on derived demand. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Derived demand</a><span class="glossdef">Demand that springs from, or is derived from, a secondary source other than the primary buyer of the product.</span></span> is demand that springs from, or is derived from, a source other than the primary buyer of a product. When it comes to B2B sales, that source is consumers. If consumers aren’t demanding the products produced by businesses, the firms that supply products to these businesses are in big trouble.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fluctuating demand</a><span class="glossdef">Demand that fluctuates sharply in response to a change in consumer demand.</span></span> is another characteristic of B2B markets: a small change in demand by consumers can have a big effect throughout the chain of businesses that supply all the goods and services that produce it. Often, a bullwhip type of effect occurs. If you have ever held a whip, you know that a slight shake of the handle will result in a big snap of the whip at its tip. Essentially, consumers are the handle and businesses along the chain compose the whip—hence the need to keep tabs on end consumers. They are a powerful purchasing force.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_s01_p03">For example, Cisco makes routers, which are specialized computers that enable computer networks to work. If Google uses five hundred routers and replaces 10 percent of them each year, that means Google usually buys fifty routers in a given year. What happens if consumer demand for the Internet falls by 10 percent? Then Google needs only 450 routers. Google’s demand for Cisco’s routers therefore becomes zero. Suppose the following year the demand for the Internet returns to normal. Google now needs to replace the fifty routers it didn’t buy in the first year plus the fifty it needs to replace in the second year. So in year two, Cisco’s sales go from zero to a hundred, or twice normal. Thus Cisco experiences a bullwhip effect, whereas Google’s sales vary only by 10 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_s01_p04">Because consumers are such a powerful force, some companies go so far as to try to influence their B2B sales by directly influencing consumers even though they don’t sell their products to them. Intel is a classic case. Do you really care what sort of microprocessing chip gets built into your computer? Intel would like you to, which is why it has run a long series of commercials on TV to think about what chip is inside your computer. The following video clip shows how they’ve continued to promote “Intel Inside” even though their actual product has changed. The commercial isn’t likely to persuade a computer manufacturer to buy Intel’s chips. But the manufacturer might be persuaded to buy them if it’s important to you. Derived demand is also the reason Intel demands that the buyers of its chips put a little “Intel Inside” sticker on each computer they make—so you get to know Intel and demand its products.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s01_s01_p06">B2B markets differ from B2C markets in many ways. There are more transactions in B2B markets and more high-dollar transactions because business products are often costly and complex. There are also fewer buyers in B2B markets, but they spend much more than the typical consumer does and have more-rigid product standards. The demand for business products is based on derived demand. Derived demand is demand that springs from, or is derived from, a secondary source other than the primary buyer of a product. For businesses, this source is consumers. Fluctuating demand is another characteristic of B2B markets: a small change in demand by consumers can have a big effect throughout the chain of businesses that supply all the goods and services that produce it.</p>

General Motors needs steel and hundreds of thousands of other products to produce cars. McDonald’s needs beef and potatoes. Delta Airlines needs fuel and planes. Your dentist needs drugs such as Novocain, oral tools, and X-ray machines. Your local tattoo parlor needs special inks and needles and a bright neon sign that flashes “open” in the middle of the night.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Every day, retailers flock to Walmart’s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, to try to hawk their products. But would it surprise you that not everybody wants to do business with a powerhouse like Walmart? Jim Wier, one-time CEO of the company that produces Snapper-brand mowers and snowblowers, actually took a trip to Walmart’s headquarters to <em class="emphasis">stop</em> doing business with the company. Why? Snapper products are high-end, heavy-duty products. Wier knew that Walmart had been selling his company’s products for lower and lower prices and wanted deeper and deeper discounts from Snapper. He believed Snapper products were too expensive for Walmart’s customers and always would be, unless the company started making cheaper-quality products or outsourced their manufacturing overseas, which is something he didn’t want to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02_p03">“The whole visit to Wal-Mart’s headquarters is a great experience,” said Wier about his trip. “It’s so crowded, you have to drive around, waiting for a parking space. You have to follow someone who is leaving, walking back to their car, and get their spot. Then you go inside this building, you register for your appointment, they give you a badge, and then you wait in the pews with the rest of the peddlers, the guy with the bras draped over his shoulder.” Eventually, would-be suppliers were taken into small cubicles where they had thirty minutes to make their case. “It’s a little like going to see the principal, really,” he said.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_002">Charles Fishman, “The Man Who Said No to Wal-Mart,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 19, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/102/open_snapper.html?page=%200%2C2">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/102/open_snapper.html?page=0%2C2</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Can you guess the biggest purchaser of goods and services in the world? It is the U.S. government. It purchases everything you can imagine, from paper and fax machines to tanks and weapons, buildings, toilets for NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration), highway construction services, and medical and security services. State and local governments buy enormous amounts of products, too. They contract with companies that provide citizens with all kinds of services from transportation to garbage collection. (So do foreign governments, provinces, and localities, of course.) <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business-to-government (B2G) markets</a><span class="glossdef">Markets in which local, state, and federal governments buy products.</span></span>, or when companies sell to local, state, and federal governments, represent a major selling opportunity, even for smaller sellers. In fact, many government entities specify that their agencies must award a certain amount of business to small businesses, minority- and women-owned businesses, and businesses owned by disabled veterans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p02">There is no one central department or place in which all these products are bought and sold. Companies that want to sell to the U.S. government should first register with the Central Contractor Registry at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.CCR.gov">http://www.CCR.gov</a>. They should then consult the General Services Administration (GSA) Web site (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gsa.gov">http://www.gsa.gov</a>). The GSA helps more than two hundred federal agencies buy a wide variety of products purchased routinely. The products can include office supplies, information technology services, repair services, vehicles, and many other products purchased by agencies on a regular basis. Consequently, it is a good starting point. However, the GSA won’t negotiate a contract for the NASA toilet or a fighter jet. It sticks to routine types of purchases.</p>

            <p class="para">The General Services Administration (GSA) is a good starting point for companies that want to do business with the federal government. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) also offers sellers a great deal of information on marketing to the government, including online courses that explain how to do it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p03">The existence of the GSA doesn’t mean the agencies it works with don’t have any say over what is purchased for them. The agencies themselves have a big say, so B2B sellers need to contact them and aggressively market their products to them. After all, agencies don’t buy products, people do. Fortunately, every agency posts on the Internet a forecast of its budget, that is, what it is planning on spending money on in the coming months. The agencies even list the names, addresses, and e-mails of contact persons responsible for purchasing decisions. Many federal agencies are able to purchase as much as $25,000 of products at a time by simply using a government credit card. This fact makes them a good target for small businesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p04">It’s not unusual for each agency or department to have its own procurement policies that must be followed. Would-be sellers are often asked to submit sealed bids that contain the details of what they are willing to provide the government and at what price. But contrary to popular belief, it’s not always the lowest bid that’s accepted. Would the United States want to send its soldiers to war in the cheapest planes and tanks, bearing the lowest-cost armor? Probably not. Like other buyers, government buyers look for the best value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e29.tanner_p-5254-20111102-151436-392876">Yet selling to the government is not always easy. The GSA has its own red tape, as does each government division, and many purchases come with additional regulations or specifications written into the legislation that funded them. Because many purchases can be rather large, decision cycles can be very long and involve large buying centers. Some businesses avoid selling to the government because the perceived hassle is too great to warrant the effort. Other businesses, though, realize that learning the ins and outs of government purchases can become a sustainable competitive advantage.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s04_p02">The businesses and products we have mentioned so far are broad generalizations to help you think about the various markets in which products can be sold. In addition, not all products a company buys are high dollar or complex. Businesses buy huge quantities of inexpensive products, too. McDonald’s, for example, buys a lot of toilet paper, napkins, bags, employee uniforms, and so forth. Pretty much any product you and I use is probably used for one or more business purposes (cell phones and cell-phone services, various types of food products, office supplies, and so on). Some of us own real estate, and so do many businesses. But very few of us own many of the other products businesses sell to one another: cranes, raw materials such as steel, fiber-optic cables, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s04_p03">That said, a smart B2B marketer will look at all the markets we have mentioned to see if they represent potential opportunities. The Red Cross will have no use for a fighter jet, of course. However, a company that manufactures toilet paper might be able to market it to both the Red Cross and the U.S. government. B2B opportunities abroad and online B2B markets can also be successfully pursued. We will discuss these topics later in the chapter.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Makes the Purchasing Decisions in Business Markets?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p01">Figuring out who exactly in B2B markets is responsible for what gets purchased and when often requires some detective work for marketing professionals and the salespeople they work with. Think about the college textbooks you buy. Who decides which ones ultimately are purchased by the students at your school? Do publishers send you e-mails about certain books they want you to buy? Do you see ads for different types of chemistry or marketing books in your school newspaper or on TV? Generally, you do not. The reason is that even though you buy the books, the publishers know that professors ultimately decide which textbooks are going to be used in the classroom. Consequently, B2B sellers largely concentrate their efforts on those people.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p02">That’s not to say that to some extent the publishers don’t target you. They may offer you a good deal by packaging a study guide with your textbook or some sort of learning supplement online you can purchase. They might also offer your bookstore manager a discount for buying a certain number of textbooks. However, a publishing company that focused on selling its textbooks directly to you or to a bookstore manager would go out of business. They know the true revenue generators are professors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p03">The question is, which professors? Some professors choose their own books. Adjunct professors often don’t have a choice—their books are chosen by a course coordinator or the dean or chair of the department. Still other decisions are made by groups of professors, some of whom have more say over the final decision than others. Are you getting the picture? Figuring out where to start in B2B sales can be a little bit like a scavenger hunt.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p04">Business buyers can be either nonprofit or for-profit businesses. There are four basic categories of business buyers: producers, resellers, governments, and institutions. Producers are companies that purchase goods and services that they transform into other products. They include both manufacturers and service providers. Resellers are companies that sell goods and services produced by other firms without materially changing them. They include wholesalers, brokers, and retailers. Local, state, and national governments purchase large quantities of goods and services. Institutional markets include nonprofit organizations such as the American Red Cross, churches, hospitals, charitable organizations, private colleges, civic clubs, and so on. Holding costs down is especially important to them because it enables them to provide their services to more people. Figuring out who exactly in B2B markets is responsible for what gets purchased and when often requires some detective work by marketing professionals and the salespeople they work with.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_p02">Buyers can have a large impact on the expenses, sales, and profits of a company. Pier 1’s purchasing agents literally comb the entire world looking for products the company’s customers want most. What happens if the products the purchasing agents pick don’t sell? Pier 1’s sales fall, and people get fired. This doesn’t happen in B2C markets. If you pick out the wrong comforter for your bed, you don’t get fired. Your bedroom just looks crummy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_p03">Consequently, professional buyers are shrewd. They have to be because their jobs depend on it.

Further, deciders take into account the input of all of the other participants: the users, influencers, and so forth.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Interpersonal and Personal Dynamics of B2B Marketing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p01">We made it a point earlier in our discussion to explain how rational and calculating business buyers are. So would it surprise you to learn that sometimes the dynamics that surround B2B marketing don’t lead to the best purchasing decisions? Interpersonal factors among the people making the buying decision often have an impact on the products chosen, good or bad. (You can think of this phenomenon as “office politics.”) For example, one person in a buying unit might wield a lot of power and greatly influence the purchasing decision. However, other people in the unit might resent the power he or she wields and insist on a different offering, even if doesn’t best meet the organization’s needs. Savvy B2B marketers are aware of these dynamics and try their best to influence the outcome.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p02">Personal factors play a part. B2B buyers are overwhelmed with choices, features, benefits, information, data, and metrics. They often have to interview dozens of potential vendors and ask them hundreds of questions. No matter how disciplined they are in their buying procedures, they will often find a way to simplify their decision making either consciously or subconsciously.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_004">Jon Miller, “Why B2B Branding Matters in B2B Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Marketo.com</em>, March 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html">http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span> For example, a buyer deciding upon multiple vendors running neck and neck might decide to simply choose the vendor whose sales representative he likes the most.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p03">Factors such as these can be difficult for a company to control. However, branding—how successful a company is at marketing its brands—<em class="emphasis">is</em> a factor under a company’s control, says Kevin Randall of Movéo Integrated Branding, an Illinois-based marketing-consulting firm. Sellers can use their brands to their advantage to help business buyers come to the conclusion that their products are the best choice. IBM, for example, has long had a strong brand name when it comes to business products. The company’s reputation was so solid that for years the catchphrase “Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM” was often repeated among purchasing agents—and by IBM salespeople of course!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_005">Jon Miller, “Why B2B Branding Matters in B2B Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Marketo.com</em>, March 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html">http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p04">In short, B2B marketing is very strategic. Selling firms try to gather as much information about their customers as they can and use that information to their advantage. As an analogy, imagine if you were interested in asking out someone you had seen on campus. Sure, you could simply try to show up at a party or somewhere on campus in the hopes of meeting the person. But if you were thinking strategically, you might try to find out everything you could about the person, what he or she likes to do and so forth, and then try to arrange a meeting. That way when you did meet the person, you would be better able to strike up a conversation and develop a relationship with him or her. B2B selling is similarly strategic. Little is left to chance.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Stages in the B2B Buying Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p01">Next, let’s look at the stages in the B2B buying process. They are similar to the stages in the consumer’s buying process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">1. A need is recognized</strong>. Someone recognizes that the organization has a need that can be solved by purchasing a good or service. Users often drive this stage, although others can serve the role of initiator. In the case of the electronic textbook, it could be, for example, the professor assigned to teach the online course. However, it could be the dean or chairman of the department in which the course is taught.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">2. The need is described and quantified</strong>. Next, the buying center, or group of people brought together to help make the buying decision, work to put some parameters around what needs to be purchased. In other words, they describe what they believe is needed, the features it should have, how much of it is needed, where, and so on. For more technical or complex products the buyer will define the product’s technical specifications. Will an off-the-shelf product do, or must it be customized?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p04">Users and influencers come into play here. In the case of our electronic book, the professor who teaches the online course, his teaching assistants, and the college’s information technology staff would try to describe the type of book best suited for the course. Should the book be posted on the Web as this book is? Should it be downloadable? Maybe it should be compatible with Amazon’s Kindle. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_f01">Figure 4.6 "An Example of Product Specifications Developed for a B2B Purchase"</a> shows the specifications developed for a janitorial-services purchase by the state of Kentucky.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">3. Potential suppliers are searched for</strong>. At this stage, the people involved in the buying process seek out information about the products they are looking for and the vendors that can supply them. Most buyers look online first to find vendors and products, then attend industry trade shows and conventions and telephone or e-mail the suppliers with whom they have relationships. The buyers might also consult trade magazines, the blogs of industry experts, and perhaps attend Webinars conducted by vendors or visit their facilities. Purchasing agents often play a key role when it comes to deciding which vendors are the most qualified. Are they reliable and financially stable? Will they be around in the future? Do they need to be located near the organization or can they be in another region of the country or in a foreign country? The vendors that don’t make the cut are quickly eliminated from the running.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">4. Qualified suppliers are asked to complete responses to requests for proposal (RFPs)</strong>. Each vendor that makes the cut is sent a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">request for proposal (RFP)</a><span class="glossdef">An invitation to submit a bid to supply the good or service.</span></span>, which is an invitation to submit a bid to supply the good or service. An RFP outlines what the vendor is able to offer in terms of its product—its quality, price, financing, delivery, after-sales service, whether it can be customized or returned, and even the product’s disposal, in some cases. Good sales and marketing professionals do more than just provide basic information to potential buyers in RFPs. They focus on the buyer’s problems and how to adapt their offers to solve those problems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p07">Oftentimes the vendors formally present their products to the people involved in the buying decision. If the good is a physical product, the vendors generally provide the purchaser with samples, which are then inspected and sometimes tested. They might also ask satisfied customers to make testimonials or initiate a discussion with the buyer to help the buyer get comfortable with the product and offer advice on how best to go about using it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">5. The proposals are evaluated and supplier(s) selected</strong>. During this stage, the RFPs are reviewed and the vendor or vendors selected. RFPs are best evaluated if the members agree on the criteria being evaluated and the importance of each. Different organizations will weigh different parts of a proposal differently, depending on their goals and the products they purchase. The price might be very important to some sellers, such as discount and dollar stores. Other organizations might be more focused on top-of-the-line goods and the service a seller provides. Recall that the maker of Snapper mowers and snowblowers was more focused on purchasing quality materials to produce top-of-the-line equipment that could be sold at a premium. Still other factors include the availability of products and the reliability with which vendors can supply them. Reliability of supply is extremely important because delays in the supply chain can shut down a company’s production of goods and services and cost the firm its customers and reputation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p09">For high-priced, complex products, after-sales service is likely to be important. A fast-food restaurant might not care too much about the after-sales service for the paper napkins it buys—just that they are inexpensive and readily available. However, if the restaurant purchases a new drive-thru ordering system, it wants to be assured that the seller will be on hand to repair the system if it breaks down and perhaps train its personnel to use the system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p10">A scorecard approach can help a company rate the RFPs. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_f02">Figure 4.7 "A Scorecard Used to Evaluate RFPs"</a> is a simple example of a scorecard completed by one member of a buying team. The scorecards completed by all the members of the buying team can then be tabulated to help determine the vendor with the highest rating.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p11"><em class="emphasis">Selecting Single versus Multiple Suppliers</em>. Sometimes organizations select a single supplier to provide the good or service. This can help streamline a company’s paperwork and other buying processes. With a single supplier, instead of negotiating two contracts and submitting two purchase orders to buy a particular offering, the company only has to do one of each. Plus, the more the company buys from one vendor, the bigger the volume discount it gets. Single sourcing can be risky, though, because it leaves a firm at the mercy of a sole supplier. What if the supplier doesn’t deliver the goods, goes out of business, or jacks up its prices? Many firms prefer to do business with more than one supplier to avoid problems such as these. Doing business with multiple suppliers keeps them on their toes. If they know their customers can easily switch their business over to another supplier, they are likely to compete harder to keep the business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p12"><strong class="emphasis bold">6. An order routine is established</strong>. This is the stage in which the actual order is put together. The order includes the agreed-upon price, quantities, expected time of delivery, return policies, warranties, and any other terms of negotiation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_006">Ron Brauner, “The B2B Process: Eight Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” Ron Brauner Integrated Marketing (Web site), July 31, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span> The order can be made on paper, online, or sent electronically from the buyer’s computer system to the seller’s. It can also be a one-time order or consist of multiple orders that are made periodically as a company needs a good or service. Some buyers order products continuously by having their vendors electronically monitor their inventory for them and ship replacement items as the buyer needs them. (We’ll talk more about inventory management in <a class="xref" href="fwk-133234-ch09#fwk-133234-ch09">Chapter 9 "Using Supply Chains to Create Value for Customers"</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p13"><strong class="emphasis bold">7. A postpurchase evaluation is conducted and the feedback provided to the vendor</strong>. Just as consumers go through an evaluation period after they purchase goods and services, so do businesses. The buying unit might survey users of the product to see how satisfied they were with it. Cessna Aircraft Company, a small U.S. airplane maker, routinely surveys the users of the products it buys so they can voice their opinions on a supplier’s performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_007">“Cessna Expands Scorecard to Indirect Suppliers,” <em class="emphasis">Purchasing</em> 138, no. 6 (June 2009): 58.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p14">Some buyers establish on-time performance, quality, customer satisfaction, and other measures for their vendors to meet, and provide those vendors with the information regularly, such as trend reports that show if their performance is improving, remaining the same, or worsening. (The process is similar to a performance evaluation you might receive as an employee.) For example, Food Lion shares a wide variety of daily retail data and performance calculations with its suppliers in exchange for their commitment to closely collaborate with the grocery-store chain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s01_p15">Keep in mind that a supplier with a poor performance record might not be entirely to blame. The purchasing company might play a role, too. For example, if the U.S. Postal Service contracts with FedEx to help deliver its holiday packages on time, but a large number of the packages are delivered late, FedEx may or may not be to blame. Perhaps a large number of loads the U.S. Postal Service delivered to FedEx were late, weather played a role, or shipping volumes were unusually high. Companies need to collaborate with their suppliers to look for ways to improve their joint performance. Some companies hold annual symposiums with their suppliers to facilitate cooperation among them and to honor their best suppliers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_008">William Copacino, “Unlocking Value through the Supplier Scorecard,” <em class="emphasis">Supply Chain Management Review</em>, July 8, 2009.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of B2B Buying Situations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p01">To some extent the stages an organization goes through and the number of people involved depend on the buying situation. Is this the first time the firm has purchased the product or the fiftieth? If it’s the fiftieth time, the buyer is likely to skip the search and other phases and simply make a purchase. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">straight rebuy</a><span class="glossdef">When a purchaser buys the same product in the same quantities from the same vendor.</span></span> is a situation in which a purchaser buys the same product in the same quantities from the same vendor. Nothing changes, in other words. Postpurchase evaluations are often skipped, unless the buyer notices an unexpected change in the offering such as a deterioration of its quality or delivery time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Sellers like straight rebuys because the buyer doesn’t consider any alternative products or search for new suppliers. The result is a steady, reliable stream of revenue for the seller. Consequently, the seller doesn’t have to spend a lot of time on the account and can concentrate on capturing other business opportunities. Nonetheless, the seller cannot ignore the account. The seller still has to provide the buyer with top-notch, reliable service or the straight-rebuy situation could be jeopardized.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p03">If an account is especially large and important, the seller might go so far as to station personnel at the customer’s place of business to be sure the customer is happy and the straight-rebuy situation continues. IBM and the management consulting firm Accenture station employees all around the world at their customers’ offices and facilities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p04">By contrast, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">new-buy</a><span class="glossdef">When a firm purchases a product for the first time.</span></span> selling situation occurs when a firm purchases a product for the first time. Generally speaking, all the buying stages we described in the last section occur. New buys are the most time consuming for both the purchasing firm and the firms selling to them. If the product is complex, many vendors and products will be considered, and many RFPs will be solicited.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p05">New-to-an-organization buying situations rarely occur. What is more likely is that a purchase is new to the people involved. For example, a school district owns buildings. But when a new high school needs to be built, there may not be anyone in management who has experience building a new school. That purchase situation is a new buy for those involved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p06">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">modified rebuy</a><span class="glossdef">When a company wants to buy the same type of product it has in the past but make some modifications to it.</span></span> occurs when a company wants to buy the same type of product it has in the past but make some modifications to it. Maybe the buyer wants different quantities, packaging, or delivery, or the product customized slightly differently. For example, your instructor might have initially adopted this textbook “as is” from its publisher, <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>, but then decided to customize it later with additional questions, problems, or content that he or she created or that was available from <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p07">A modified rebuy doesn’t necessarily have to be made with the same seller, however. Your instructor may have taught this course before, using a different publisher’s book. High textbook costs, lack of customization, and other factors may have led to dissatisfaction. In this case, she might visit with some other textbook suppliers and see what they have to offer. Some buyers routinely solicit bids from other sellers when they want to modify their purchases in order to get sellers to compete for their business. Likewise, savvy sellers look for ways to turn straight rebuys into modified buys so they can get a shot at the business. They do so by regularly visiting with customers and seeing if they have unmet needs or problems a modified product might solve.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s04_s02_p08">The stages in the B2B buying process are as follows: Someone recognizes that the organization has a need that can be solved by purchasing a good or service. The need is described and quantified. Qualified suppliers are searched for, and each qualified supplier is sent a request for proposal (RFP), which is an invitation to submit a bid to supply the good or service. The proposals suppliers submit are evaluated, one or more supplier(s) selected, and an order routine with each is established. A postpurchase evaluation is later conducted and the feedback provided to the suppliers. The buying stages an organization goes through often depend on the buying situation—whether it’s a straight rebuy, new buy, or modified rebuy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">International B2B Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s01_p01">Another characteristic of B2B markets that you may or may not have noticed or thought about is that firms in the same industry tend to cluster in the same geographic areas. In the United States, many banks and financial companies are located on or near Wall Street in New York City. Many film and television companies operate out of Hollywood. Is it just by chance that this has occurred? No.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s01_p02">The clustering occurs because the resources these firms need—both human and natural—are located in some areas and not others. For example, the Gulf of Mexico is rich with oil deposits. As a result, many oil companies and facilities are located along or near the Gulf in cities such as Houston. Likewise, many high-tech companies are located in Silicon Valley (California). One reason is that nearby Stanford University is one of the top computer-science schools in the country and the firms want to hire graduates from the school.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s01_p03">But that’s not the only reason businesses in the same industry cluster together. Another reason is the sellers want to be close to their buyers. Bentonville, Arkansas, the world headquarters of Walmart, used to be a sleepy little rural town. As Walmart grew, so have the number of companies moving into the area to do business with Walmart. In the last twenty years, the size of the town has nearly tripled.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Why do companies want to be near their buyers? Let’s go back to our date analogy. Suppose you hit it off with the person you’re interested in and you become “an item.” You probably wouldn’t want to be half the world away from the person for a long period of time because you would miss the person and because you wouldn’t want a rival moving in on your turf! The same is true for sellers. Buyers also want to be close to their suppliers because it can help them get inventory more quickly. Dell’s suppliers are located right next to the company’s assembly plants. And, as you have learned, some companies actually locate their personnel on their customers’ sites.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">B2B E-Commerce</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_p05">Not all B2B buyers and sellers are cozying up to one another location-wise today, though: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">e-commerce</a><span class="glossdef">Commerce conducted electronically, such as over the Internet.</span></span>, or commerce conducted electronically, such as over the Internet, has made locating near buyers less important. Consider the Hubert Company, a Cincinnati-based firm that sells supplies to the food industry. “Just ten years ago the Internet didn’t exist for the Hubert Company, and today almost 30 percent of our business comes through the Internet as an ordering mechanism,” says Bart Kohler, president of the company.<span class="footnote" id="tanner_p-5254-20111102-152749-128700">Information from Bart Kohler based on a telephone interview conducted by Dr. Camille Schuster.</span> However, the Hubert Company can no longer protect the market in and around Cincinnati just because it’s headquartered there. “Whereas in the past, I was somewhat insulated to just people in my area, now there really are no geographic boundaries anymore, and anyone can compete with me anywhere,” Kohler explains. The advantage is that whereas the United States is a mature market in which growth is limited, other countries, like Brazil, India, and China, are growing like crazy and represent huge e-commerce opportunities for the Hubert Company, he says.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_p06">B2B e-commerce was actually a little slower to take hold than B2C e-commerce, though. Initially, the Web sites of many B2B firms were static. There was no interactivity. “We put our first Web site up in 1998, and it really didn’t do anything,” Kohler explains. “All it did was it had the picture of the company. I think it had a picture of me holding a catalog with a toll-free number at the bottom, and said, ‘Hey, call this number and we’ll send you a catalog.’”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_p07">Things have changed. Companies have since developed sophisticated e-commerce systems that allow their customers to do many things for themselves. As a result, they have been able to cut down on the amount of customer service they need to provide. Does your business want to ship your products cheaply across the country via rail? You can sign up online for an account with a railroad like Union Pacific (UP), reserve some rail cars on UP’s site, and choose the route you want them to travel. Later, after you ship the goods, you can check your account balance on the Web site and track the rail cars online like when packages are shipped with FedEx and UPS. The office supply chain Staples has special Web sites set up for each of its business customers, which are customized with online catalogs containing the types of products they buy at the prices they seem to be willing to pay, based on their past purchases on StaplesLink.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_010">Efraim Turban, Jae K.

(You can think of the exchanges as being somewhat like Craigslist but composed solely of business buyers and sellers.) Sites such as these make their money by charging buyers and sellers a fee when they conduct transactions with one another. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, B2B exchanges sprouted up on the Internet like weeds. Cyber entrepreneurs took a “build it and they will come” attitude, hoping to earn a fee off the transactions conducted on site. Many of these sites have failed, but not all of them. One of the most successful and largest exchanges is Alibaba.com, founded in 1999 as a trading platform for small and medium manufacturers to sell their wares.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_011">“Company Overview,” <em class="emphasis">Alibaba.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/index.html">http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/index.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span> ChemNet.com is a global exchange where companies go to buy and sell chemicals of all kinds.

The auctions can be either sell side or buy side. An example of a sell-side auction is a B2B auction that occurs on eBay or a site like AssetAuctions.com where surplus industrial equipment is sold. Motorola regularly sells small quantities of products at the end of their life cycles on eBay. Motorola has found that eBay is a good way to make some money from products that businesses are reluctant to buy otherwise because they are being discontinued.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_012">“Motorola Finds Higher Return in B2B Auctions on eBay,” <em class="emphasis">internetretailer.com</em>, March 23, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.internetretailer.com/dailyNews.asp?id=8291">http://www.internetretailer.com/dailyNews.asp?id=8291</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span> Sell-side auctions are sometimes referred to as forward auctions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s01_p04">Buy-side auctions, by contrast, reverse the traditional auction formula, which is to help the seller get the highest price for the product. Instead, the buyer initiates the auction in order to find the cheapest supplier of a product. Sellers then bid against one another, offering the lowest prices they can for their products, in order to get the buyer’s business. Because the roles of the buyers and sellers are reversed in buy-side auctions, they are often referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reverse auctions</a><span class="glossdef">When the buyer lists what he or she wants to buy and also states how much he or she is willing to pay. The reverse auction is finished when at least one firm is willing to accept the buyer’s price.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s01_p05">Not all companies use an intermediary like eBay or AssetAuctions to conduct their auctions, though. Some companies conduct their own auctions on their Web sites so they don’t have to pay a fee to an intermediary. For example, General Motors auctions off reconditioned vehicles to auto dealers on its own Web site, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gmonlineauctions.com">http://www.gmonlineauctions.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Pricing in E-commerce Markets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p01">One of the consequences of e-commerce is that B2B customers can easily shop around from the convenience of their cubicles or offices, bid on products, and read blogs about products from industry experts. That’s what buyers generally do before they get on the phone or personally meet with sellers. E-commerce has made it especially easy for buyers to compare prices. And the cheapest price often attracts the most attention.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p02">The result is that B2B sellers (and B2C sellers) have found their ability to raise prices is limited. The problem is more acute when products are very similar to one another (commodities) and B2B auctions and exchanges are utilized. If you are a buyer of chemicals looking for a supplier on ChemNet, do you want to pay more for one brand of a chemical that has the same molecular formula as every other brand? Maybe not. However, if you believe you can get better service from one company than from another, you might pay more. “Everything has become much more of a commodity, commodity meaning that it’s basically more and more about price,” says Kohler about e-commerce competition. “So my challenge as a distributor is that I have got to constantly find new ways to try to create value for Hubert’s customers.” When he is able to find a new way to create value, the decision becomes less about price and he can compete more effectively.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p03">To avoid e-commerce price wars, some companies refuse to sell their products directly online or put prices on them. Snapper products are an example. Go to Snapper.com, and you will find a lot of information about Snapper mowers and snowblowers online and dealers where you can buy them. But you won’t see any prices listed. Nor can you buy a product directly from the Web site.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p04">Firms in the same industry tend to cluster in the same geographic areas because the resources these firms need—both human and natural—are located in some areas and not others. Sellers also want to be close to their buyers. E-commerce, or commerce conducted electronically such as over the Internet, has made locating near buyers less important for business-to-business sellers and opened up opportunities for them to sell their products around the world. However, e-commerce has also led to more competition and made it difficult for sellers to raise their prices. B2B e-commerce was slower to take hold than B2C e-commerce. Companies have since developed sophisticated e-commerce systems, including sell-side and buy-side Web sites, exchanges, and B2B auctions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p01">It’s likely that every topic we have talked about so far in this chapter has an ethical dimension to it. Take procurement, for example: unlike B2C markets, offering customers free dinners, golf games, and so forth is very common in B2B settings. In many foreign countries, business and government buyers not only expect perks such as these but also actually demand bribes be paid if you want to do business with them. And firms pay them, even though some countries prohibit them. (The United States is one such country.) Which countries have a penchant for bribery? In a report called the “Bribe Payers Index,” Transparency International, a watchdog organization, annually ranks the likelihood of firms from the world’s industrialized countries to bribe abroad. The top five countries are shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch04_s06_t01">Table 4.3 "Transparency International’s Bribe Payers Index"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p02">Or take, for example, the straight-rebuy situation we discussed earlier. Recall that in a straight rebuy, buyers repurchase products automatically. Recently, Dean Foods, which manufactures the Silk brand of soy milk, experienced a lot of negative press after the company changed the word “organic” to “natural” on the labels of its milk, and quietly switched to conventional soybeans, which are often grown with pesticides. But Dean didn’t change the barcode for the product, the packaging of the product, or the price much. So stores kept ordering what they thought was the same product—making a straight rebuy—but it wasn’t. Many stores and consumers felt as though they had been duped. Some grocers dropped the entire Silk lineup of products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_013">Richard Waters and Nikki Tait, “Intel Settles Antitrust AMD Case for $1.2 Billion,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, November 13, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/789729c2-cff4-11de-a36d-00144feabdc0.html">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/789729c2-cff4-11de-a36d-00144feabdc0.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p03">And remember Intel’s strategy to increase the demand for its chips by insisting that PC makers use “Intel Inside” stickers? Recently Intel paid a competitor more than a billion dollars to settle a court case contending that it strong-armed PC makers into doing business exclusively with Intel. (Does that make you feel less warm and fuzzy about the “Intel Inside” campaign?)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p04">What Dean Foods and Intel did might strike you as being wrong. However, what is ethical and what is not is often not clear-cut. Walmart has a reputation for using its market power to squeeze its suppliers for the best deals possible, in some cases putting them out of business. Is that ethical? What about companies that hire suppliers abroad, putting U.S. companies and workers out of business? Is that wrong? It depends on whom you ask. Some economists believe Walmart’s ability to keep costs low has benefited consumers far more than it has hurt the suppliers of products. Is it fair to prohibit U.S. companies from offering bribes when their foreign competitors can?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p05">Clearly, people have very different ideas about what’s ethical and what’s not. So how does a business get all of its employees on the same page in terms of how they behave? Laws and regulations—state, federal, and international—are an obvious starting point for companies, their executives, and employees wanting to do the right thing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) often plays a role when it comes to B2B laws and regulations. The FTC regulates companies in an effort to prevent them from engaging in unfair trade practices that can harm consumers and hamper competition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e39.tanner_p-5254-20111102-152910-084317">Further, companies that sell to the government must, by law, follow very strict ethical guidelines. These companies tend to make such guidelines their policy because it is easier to make sure that the federal regulations are followed all of the time than only when selling to the government.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p06">Companies are also adopting ethics codes that provide general guidelines about how their employees should behave. Many firms require employees to go through ethics training so they know what to do when they face tricky ethical dilemmas. Large corporations have begun hiring “chief ethics officers” to ensure ethics are properly implemented within their organizations. The Business Marketing Association has also developed a code of ethics that discourages bribery and other practices, such as disparaging a competitor’s products unfairly, and encourages treating one’s suppliers equitably.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p07">As for Walmart, you can’t fault the company’s procurement practices. Walmart’s purchasing agents aren’t allowed to accept a lunch, dinner, golf game, or so much as a cup of coffee from potential vendors. Walmart is not the only company to have implemented such a policy. More and more firms have followed suit because (1) they realize that perks such as these drive up product costs and (2) they don’t want their buyers making decisions based on what they personally can get out of them rather than what’s best for the company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p08">All things equal, companies want to do business with firms that are responsible. They don’t want to be associated with firms that are not. Why is this important? Because that’s what consumers are increasingly demanding. A few years ago, Nike and a number of other apparel makers were lambasted when it came to light that the factories they contracted with were using child labor and keeping workers toiling for long hours under terrible conditions. Nike didn’t own the factories, but it still got a bad rap. Today, Nike, Inc., uses a “balanced scorecard.” When evaluating suppliers, it looks at their labor-code compliance along with measures such as price, quality, and delivery time. During crunch times, it allows some Chinese factories latitude by, for example, permitting them to adjust when employees can take days off.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_014">Dexter Roberts, Pete Engardio, Aaron Bernstein, Stanley Holmes, and Xiang Ji, “How to Make Factories Play Fair,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, November 27, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_48/b4011006.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_48/b4011006.htm</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p09">Similarly, Walmart has developed a scorecard to rate its suppliers on how their packaging of products affects the environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_015">Mark Arzoumanian, “Wal-Mart Updates <em class="emphasis">Scorecard</em> Status,” <em class="emphasis">Official Board Markets</em> 84, no. 46 (November 15, 2008): 1, 4.</span> Walmart does so because its customers are becoming more conscious of environmental damage and see value in products that are produced in as environmentally friendly a way as possible.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s06_p10">Ethics come into play in almost all business settings. Business-to-business markets are no different. For example, unlike B2C markets, offering customers perks is very common in B2B settings.

Understanding the laws and regulations that apply to their firms is an obvious starting point for companies, their executives, and employees in terms of knowing how to act ethically.

            <li>When your family makes a major purchase, such as choosing a vacation destination or buying furniture, does it resemble a buying center? If so, who plays what roles?</li>
            <li>Katie is a forklift operator who is tired of her forklift breaking down. She points out to her boss, the plant supervisor, that her forklift is broken down at least 20 percent of the time, and it is beginning to impact production. The plant supervisor tells the purchasing agent that a new forklift is needed and asks the purchasing agent to get three bids on new ones with similar features. The purchasing agent calls three companies and gets bids, which the plant supervisor uses to narrow it down to two. He then has Katie test drive the two and since she liked the Yamamatsu best, he decides to purchase that one. What roles do the supervisor and Katie play in this firm’s buying center? Does the process followed resemble the process outlined in the chapter? If not, why not?</li>

            <li>Congratulations, you just made a sale! For the first time in five years, the Humongo Corporation purchased from your company. How do you turn this into a straight rebuy? What product characteristics might make this goal easier to accomplish? What buyer characteristics might make it more difficult to accomplish?</li>
            <li>Consider a company where marketing and sales are two different departments. Their customers are other businesses. Using both the buying center and buying process, describe what the marketing department actually does. What do salespeople actually do?</li>

            <li>Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.ism.ws/">http://www.ism.ws/</a>. What is the purpose of this site and the organization that created it? How does the ISM help its members with ethical dilemmas? Be specific, with specific examples from the site.</li>
            <li>Many B2B marketers use NAICS to segment their market. Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html">http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</a>.
