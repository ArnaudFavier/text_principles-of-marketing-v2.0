        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s06_l01">
            <li>How is marketing capital equipment different from marketing MRO offerings?</li>
            <li>What are the marketing implications for your company if buyers stop viewing your primary offering as a shopping good and begin considering it a convenience good? How would you respond to the change?</li>
            <li>Can you market unsought goods? If so, how?</li>
            <li>How does packaging add value for consumers and retailers?</li>
            <li>If consumers find the most value in the services of your offering rather than the tangible product, how will perishability, intangibility, variability, and inseparability influence your marketing? Be specific for each characteristic.</li>
            <li>Choose two of the different marketing jobs or positions described and compare and contrast the challenges associated with each. One position should be one you would want while the other is one you would not. Why did you pick one over the other?</li>
            <li>Describe three decisions that would be made differently from a product-dominant approach when compared to a service-dominant approach. What is each decision and how would it be different?</li>
            <li>When would a product orientation be useful? Why?</li>
            <li>Describe an example of a core product where there are many different augmented products and the augmented products are considered very different by the consumer or user.</li>
            <li>The text says that branding is much more than labeling or packaging. Provide some examples where you believe the product did not live up to the brand. Using examples to illustrate how consistency works, discuss how the offering and the desired brand image have to be consistent.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="title">Activities</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-133234-ch06_s06_l02">
            <li>Identify three television commercials designed to persuade buyers to view the products being advertised as shopping items rather than convenience items. What is similar about the strategies employed in the commercials? Do you think the commercials are successful? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Identify a product for which packaging adds value and describe how that value is added for the consumer. Identify a second brand for which the organization uses primary packaging to distinguish the brand at the point of purchase, and describe how the package contributes to the branding. Do not use brands used as examples in the chapter. Finally, identify a pure service brand and describe how that service is “packaged.”</li>
            <li>Select two brands that serve the same market but are not discussed in the chapter. Using print advertising, screen shots from Web sites, and stills from commercials (use screen shots from streaming video), assemble supporting material that helps you describe what each brand stands for and how consumers view each brand. Is one brand better than the other? Why or why not?</li>
