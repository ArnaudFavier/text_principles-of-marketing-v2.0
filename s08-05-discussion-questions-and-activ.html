        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s05_l01">
            <li>Think about some of your friends and what you have discovered by visiting their homes. Do they buy different things than you do? If so, why? How might a company distinguish you from them in terms of its targeting?</li>
            <li>Staples and The Limited have attempted to thwart shoppers who abuse store return policies. When a customer returns items, store clerks swipe the customer’s driver’s license through electronic card readers that track buying and return patterns for any suspicious activity.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_040">Liz Pulliam Weston, “The Basics: Are You a Bad Customer?” <em class="emphasis">MSN Money</em>.</span> What drawbacks do you think such a strategy could have?</li>
            <li>Is it always harder to find new customers than it is to retain old ones or does it depend on the business you’re in?</li>
            <li>Does one-to-one marketing have to be expensive? How can small organizations interact with their customers in a cost-effective way?</li>
            <li>Are large companies better off using multisegment strategies and small companies better off using niche strategies? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How have companies such as JCPenney and Sears tried to change their position (reposition their stores)?</li>
            <li>Do you think hotel companies have segmented the market too much and confused customers?</li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s05_l02">
            <li>Visit <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://aclu.org/pizza/images/screen.swf">http://aclu.org/pizza/images/screen.swf</a> to see a video created by the American Civil Liberties Union in an effort to warn consumers about the information being collected about them. Do you think the video is far-fetched? Or do you think consumers should be alarmed? In your opinion, do the potential benefits of CRM databases exceed the potential downsides—or not?</li>
            <li>Form groups of three students. Think of a product or service that one of you purchased recently on campus. How might you go about developing a customer profile for the product? List the sources you would use.</li>
            <li>Describe a product you like that you believe more people should use. As a marketer, how would you reposition the product to increase its use? Outline your strategy.</li>
            <li>Look at the latest census data and identify at least two areas of the country that are growing. What type of businesses would you recommend enter the growing markets?</li>
            <li>Think of an idea for a new product or service. Who would be the target market(s) and how would you position your offering?</li>
