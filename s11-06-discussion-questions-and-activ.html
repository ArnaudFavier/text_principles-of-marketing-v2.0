            <li>Amazon.com has carved out a unique niche for itself as an intermediary.

            <li>Describe a time in which you did business with a company and received conflicting information from its different channels (for example, a store’s Web site versus a visit to the store). How did it affect your buying experience? Have you done business with the company since?</li>
            <li>Break into groups and make a list of four to five different types of products. Decide which channels should be used to distribute each product. Present your findings to your class and see if they agree with you.</li>
            <li>Make a list of products you believe failed because of poor marketing channel choices.</li>
