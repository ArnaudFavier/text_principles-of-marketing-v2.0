Large organizations often have permanent departments that consist of the people who, in a sense, shop for a living. They are professional buyers, in other words. Their titles vary. In some companies, they are simply referred to as <em class="emphasis">buyers</em>. In other companies, they are referred to as <em class="emphasis">purchasing agents</em>, <em class="emphasis">purchasing managers</em>, or <em class="emphasis">procurement officers</em>. Retailers often refer to their buyers as <em class="emphasis">merchandisers</em>. Most of the people who do these jobs have bachelor’s of science degrees. Some undergo additional industry training to obtain an advanced purchasing certification designation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_003">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Purchasing Managers, Buyers, and Purchasing Agents,” <em class="emphasis">Occupational Outlook Handbook</em>, 2010–11 ed., December 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos023.htm">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos023.htm</a> (accessed January 8, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_p02">Buyers can have a large impact on the expenses, sales, and profits of a company. Pier 1’s purchasing agents literally comb the entire world looking for products the company’s customers want most. What happens if the products the purchasing agents pick don’t sell? Pier 1’s sales fall, and people get fired. This doesn’t happen in B2C markets. If you pick out the wrong comforter for your bed, you don’t get fired. Your bedroom just looks crummy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_p03">Consequently, professional buyers are shrewd. They have to be because their jobs depend on it. Their jobs depend on their choosing the best products at the best prices from the best vendors. Professional buyers are also well informed and less likely to buy a product on a whim than consumers. The following sidebar outlines the tasks professional buyers generally perform.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_p04">Increasingly, purchasing managers have become responsible for buying not only products but also functions their firms want to outsource. The functions aren’t limited to manufacturing. They also include product innovation and design services, customer service and order fulfillment services, and information technology and networking services to name a few. Purchasing agents responsible for finding offshore providers of goods and services often take trips abroad to inspect the facilities of the providers and get a better sense of their capabilities.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Other Players</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Purchasing agents don’t make all the buying decisions in their companies, though. As we explained, other people in the organization often have a say, as well they should. Purchasing agents frequently need their feedback and help to buy the best products and choose the best vendors. The people who provide their firms’ buyers with input generally fall into one or more of the following groups:</p>

But they don’t stop there; whether they have the ability to make the final decision of what to buy or not, they get the ball rolling. Sometimes they initiate the purchase by simply notifying purchasing agents of what is needed; other times they have to lobby executives to consider making a change.</p>

Frequently, one or more users serve as an initiator in an effort to improve what they produce or how they produce it, and they certainly have the responsibility for implementing what is purchased. Users often have certain specifications in mind for products and how they want them to perform. An example of a user might be a professor at your school who wants to adopt an electronic book and integrate it into his or her online course.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Gatekeepers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s01_s03_p01">If you want to sell a product to a large company like Walmart, you can’t just walk in the door of its corporate headquarters and demand to see a purchasing agent. You will first have to get past of a number of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gatekeepers</a><span class="glossdef">People who decide if and when a salesperson gets access to members of the buying center.</span></span>, or people who will decide if and when you get access to members of the buying center. These are people such as buying assistants, personal assistants, and other individuals who have some say about which sellers are able to get a foot in the door.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s01_s03_p02">Gatekeepers often need to be courted as hard as prospective buyers do. They generally have a lot of information about what’s going on behind the scenes and a certain amount of informal power. If they like you, you’re in a good position as a seller. If they don’t, your job is going to be <em class="emphasis">much</em> harder. In the case of textbook sales, the gatekeepers are often faculty secretaries. They know in advance which instructors will be teaching which courses and the types of books they will need. It is not uncommon for faculty secretaries to screen the calls of textbook sales representatives.</p>

The decider might or might not be the purchasing manager. Purchasing managers are generally solely responsible for deciding upon routine purchases and small purchases. However, the decision to purchase a large, expensive product that will have a major impact on a company is likely to be made by or with the help of other people in the organization, perhaps even the CEO. The decision may be made by a single decider, or there may be a few who reach consensus. Further, deciders take into account the input of all of the other participants: the users, influencers, and so forth. Sellers, of course, pay special attention to what deciders want. “Who makes the buying decision?” is a key question B2B sales and marketing personnel are trained to quickly ask potential customers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Interpersonal and Personal Dynamics of B2B Marketing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p01">We made it a point earlier in our discussion to explain how rational and calculating business buyers are. So would it surprise you to learn that sometimes the dynamics that surround B2B marketing don’t lead to the best purchasing decisions? Interpersonal factors among the people making the buying decision often have an impact on the products chosen, good or bad. (You can think of this phenomenon as “office politics.”) For example, one person in a buying unit might wield a lot of power and greatly influence the purchasing decision. However, other people in the unit might resent the power he or she wields and insist on a different offering, even if doesn’t best meet the organization’s needs. Savvy B2B marketers are aware of these dynamics and try their best to influence the outcome.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p02">Personal factors play a part. B2B buyers are overwhelmed with choices, features, benefits, information, data, and metrics. They often have to interview dozens of potential vendors and ask them hundreds of questions. No matter how disciplined they are in their buying procedures, they will often find a way to simplify their decision making either consciously or subconsciously.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_004">Jon Miller, “Why B2B Branding Matters in B2B Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Marketo.com</em>, March 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html">http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span> For example, a buyer deciding upon multiple vendors running neck and neck might decide to simply choose the vendor whose sales representative he likes the most.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p03">Factors such as these can be difficult for a company to control. However, branding—how successful a company is at marketing its brands—<em class="emphasis">is</em> a factor under a company’s control, says Kevin Randall of Movéo Integrated Branding, an Illinois-based marketing-consulting firm. Sellers can use their brands to their advantage to help business buyers come to the conclusion that their products are the best choice. IBM, for example, has long had a strong brand name when it comes to business products. The company’s reputation was so solid that for years the catchphrase “Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM” was often repeated among purchasing agents—and by IBM salespeople of course!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_005">Jon Miller, “Why B2B Branding Matters in B2B Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Marketo.com</em>, March 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html">http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/03/b2b_branding_wh.html</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p04">In short, B2B marketing is very strategic. Selling firms try to gather as much information about their customers as they can and use that information to their advantage. As an analogy, imagine if you were interested in asking out someone you had seen on campus. Sure, you could simply try to show up at a party or somewhere on campus in the hopes of meeting the person. But if you were thinking strategically, you might try to find out everything you could about the person, what he or she likes to do and so forth, and then try to arrange a meeting. That way when you did meet the person, you would be better able to strike up a conversation and develop a relationship with him or her. B2B selling is similarly strategic. Little is left to chance.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s03_s02_p05">Buying centers are groups of people within organizations who make purchasing decisions. The buying centers of large organizations employ professional buyers who, in a sense, shop for a living. They don’t make all the buying decisions in their companies, though. The other people who provide input are users, or the people and groups within the organization that actually use the product; influencers, or people who may or may not use the product but have experience or expertise that can help improve the buying decision; gatekeepers, or people who will decide if and when a seller gets access to members of the buying center; and deciders, or the people who make the final purchasing decision. Interpersonal dynamics between the people in a buying center will affect the choices the center makes. Personal factors, such as how likeable a seller is, play a part because buyers are often overwhelmed with information and will find ways to simplify their decision making.</p>
