    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p01">Suppose you have developed a great new product like <em class="emphasis">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</em>. Not only is the game terrific, but you’ve managed to maximize to get it sold in every marketing channel you can. The product is selling at GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon, and it’s slated to come out on Sony’s PlayStation Portable console. That’s the end of the story, right? Not quite. Sooner rather than later, in addition to focusing on the firms “downstream” that sell <em class="emphasis">your product</em>, you will also look “upstream” at your suppliers and “sideways” at potential firms to partner with. It’s only natural. (Or in the case of <em class="emphasis">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</em>, should we say <em class="emphasis">supernatural</em>?)</p>

        <p class="para">Mark Randel, John O’Keefe, and Brendan Goss, the founders of the company that produced the new Ghostbusters video game, say they had to satisfy two types of customers with the product—gamers and fans of the original <em class="emphasis">Ghostbusters</em> movie. Check out the demo.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p02">As we explained in <a class="xref" href="fwk-133234-ch08#fwk-133234-ch08">Chapter 8 "Using Marketing Channels to Create Value for Customers"</a>, your product’s supply chain includes not only the downstream companies that actively sell the product but also all the other organizations that have an impact on it before, during, and after it’s produced. Those companies include the providers of the raw materials your firm uses to produce it, the transportation company that physically moves it, and the firm that helped build the Web pages to promote it. If you hired a programmer in India to help write computer code for the game, the Indian programmer is also part of the product’s supply chain. If you hired a company to process copies of the game returned by customers, that company is part of the supply chain as well. Large organizations with many products can have literally thousands of supply chain partners. Service organizations also need supplies to operate, so they have supply chains, too.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p03">As you learned at the end of the last chapter, the process of designing, monitoring, and altering supply chains to make them as efficient as possible is called <strong class="emphasis bold">supply chain management</strong>. The term <em class="emphasis">supply chain management</em> was first coined by an American industry consultant in the early 1980s, but it’s an old idea. Part of Henry Ford’s strategy in the early 1900s was to extract as much efficiency (and money) as he could by taking ownership of the supply chains for his automobiles. Ford owned the foundries that converted raw iron ore to steel for his cars. He also owned the plantations from which rubber was extracted to produce his automobiles’ tires, and the ships on which the materials and finished products were transported.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_001">Donald J. Bowersox and David J. Closs, “Ten Mega-Trends That Will Revolutionize Supply Chain Logistics,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Logistics</em> 21, no. 2 (2000): 1.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p04">Today, many companies still take a narrow view of their supply chains; they look at supply chains mainly in terms of the costs they can save. Cost reduction is definitely an important part of supply chain management. After all, if your competitors can produce their products at a lower cost, they could put you out of business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p05">Keep in mind, however, that a firm can produce a product so cheaply that no one will buy it because it’s shoddy. That’s why smart companies view their supply chains as an integral part of their marketing plans. In other words, these companies also look at the ways their supply chains can create value for customers so as to give their firms a competitive edge.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p06">Today, the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value chain</a><span class="glossdef">A term that is sometimes used interchangeably with the term supply chain. The idea behind the value chain is that your supply chain partners should do more for you than perform just basic functions.</span></span> is sometimes used interchangeably with the term <em class="emphasis">supply chain</em>. The idea behind the value chain is that your supply chain partners should do more for you than perform just basic functions; each one should help you create more value for customers as the product travels along the chain—preferably more value than your competitors’ supply chain partners can add to their products.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_p07">Zara, a trendy but inexpensive clothing chain in Europe, is a good example of a company that has managed to create value for its customers with smart supply chain design and execution. Originally, it took six months for Zara to design a garment and get it delivered to stores. To get the hottest fashions in the hands of customers as sooner, Zara began working more closely with its supply chain partners and internal design teams. It also automated its inventory systems so it could quickly figure out what was selling and what was not. As a result, it’s now able to deliver its customers the most cutting-edge fashion in just two weeks. Not only that, but the company set a new standard for the clothing industry in the process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_002">Jeremy N.

Sourcing and procurement have become a bigger part of a supply manager’s job in recent years, in part because businesses keep becoming more specialized.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_p02">Ford Motor Company no longer produces its own tires for its cars. It buys them from tire producers like Michelin and Goodyear. It’s still possible to “own” your supply chain, though. The diamond company DeBeers owns its own mines, distributorships, and retail diamond stores. The problem is that it’s very costly to own multiple types of companies and difficult to run them all well, too.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_p03">Firms look up and down their supply chains and outside them to see which companies can add the most value to their products at the least cost.

After all, why do something yourself if someone else can do it better or more cost-effectively?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_p04">Rather than their own fleets of trucks, ships, and airplanes, most companies outsource at least some of their transportation tasks to shippers such as Roadway and FedEx. Other companies hire freight forwarders to help them. You can think of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">freight forwarders</a><span class="glossdef">An organization whose duties include consolidating small loads of freight, negotiating rates for their shipment, and booking space for them on transportation vehicles and in warehouses.</span></span> as travel agents for freight.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_003">Skip McGrath, “China Shipping Advice,” <em class="emphasis">Smart China Sourcing</em>, December 14, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smartchinasourcing.com/shipping/china-shipping-advice-cif-shipping-terms-explained.html">http://www.smartchinasourcing.com/shipping/china-shipping-advice-cif-shipping-terms-explained.html</a> (accessed April 13, 2012).</span> Their duties include negotiating rates for shipments and booking space for them on transportation vehicles and in warehouses. A freight forwarder also combines small loads from various shippers into larger loads that can be shipped by more economically. However, it doesn’t own its own transportation equipment or warehouses.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_p05">Other companies go a step further and outsource their entire order processing and shipping departments to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">third-party logistics (3PLs) firms</a><span class="glossdef">Firms to which other companies outsource their entire order processing and shipping departments.</span></span>. FedEx Supply Chain Services and UPS Supply Chain Solutions (which are divisions of FedEx and UPS, respectively) are examples of 3PLs. A 3PL is one-stop shipping solution for a company that wants to focus on other aspects of its business. Firms that receive and ship products internationally often hire 3PLs so they don’t have to deal with the headaches of transporting products abroad and completing import and export paperwork for them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Growth of Outsourcing and Offshoring</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Beginning in the 1990s, companies began to outsource a lot of other activities besides transportation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_004">Skip McGrath, “China Shipping Advice,” <em class="emphasis">Smart China Sourcing</em>, December 14, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smartchinasourcing.com/shipping/china-shipping-advice-cif-shipping-terms-explained.html">http://www.smartchinasourcing.com/shipping/china-shipping-advice-cif-shipping-terms-explained.html</a> (accessed April 13, 2012).</span> Their goal was twofold: (1) to lower their costs and (2) to focus on the activities they do best. You might be surprised by the functions firms outsource. In fact, many “producers” of products no longer produce them at all but outsource their production instead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Most clothing companies, including Nike, design products, but they don’t make them. Instead, they send their designs to companies in nations with low labor costs. Likewise, many drug companies no longer develop their own drugs. They outsource the task to smaller drug developers, which in recent years have had a better track record of developing best-selling pharmaceuticals. The Crest SpinBrush (toothbrush) wasn’t developed by Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Crest. A small company called Church &amp; Dwight Co. developed the technology for the SpinBrush, and P&amp;G purchased the right to market and sell the product.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Some of the Ins and Outs of Outsourcing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p01">A company faces a number of tradeoffs when it outsources an activity. The loss of control—particularly when it comes to product quality and safety—is one of them. Just ask Mattel. Beginning in 2007, Mattel was forced to recall tens of millions of toys it had outsourced for production because they were tainted with lead. But Mattel isn’t the only company to experience problems. In a recent global survey, more than one-fifth of the companies that outsource their production said they have experienced “frequent” and “serious” quality problems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_006">PRTM Management Consultants, “Global Supply Chain Trends 2008–2010,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.prtm.com/uploadedFiles/Strategic_Viewpoint/Articles/Article_Content/Global_Supply_Chain_Trends_Report_%202008.pdf">http://www.prtm.com/uploadedFiles/Strategic_Viewpoint/Articles/Article_Content/Global_Supply_Chain_Trends_Report_%202008.pdf</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p02">The U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission randomly inspects products, but there is no way the commission’s personnel can begin to test them all. To protect their customers, many companies either test their suppliers’ products themselves or contract with independent labs to do so. For example, if you sell a product to Walmart, you need to be prepared to send it to such a lab, should Walmart ask you to.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_007">“Quality Assurance through Testing,” <em class="emphasis">Walmartstores.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://walmartstores.com/Suppliers/248.aspx">http://walmartstores.com/Suppliers/248.aspx</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span> Companies also do on-site audits, or checks, of their suppliers. Other companies station employees with their suppliers on a permanent basis to be sure that the quality of the products they’re producing is acceptable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p03">The loss of control of their technology is another outsourcing risk that companies face. Some countries are better about protecting patented technologies and designs than others, and some supply chain partners are more trustworthy than others. How can you be sure your supply chain partner won’t steal your technology? A few years ago, General Motors began working with a Chinese firm to produce a car called the Spark for the Chinese market. But before GM could even get the automobile plant up and running, the U.S. automaker alleged that the design of the car had been stolen, sold to another company, and knockoffs of it were being driven around China’s streets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_008">Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State, “China Pressed to Forcefully Attack Intellectual Property Theft,” America.gov, January 13, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/20050113180002asesuark0.9782831.html#ixzz0Mada2mLk">http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/20050113180002asesuark0.9782831.html#ixzz0Mada2mLk</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p04">Another aspect of outsourcing relates to the social responsibility and environmental sustainability companies exhibit in terms of how they manage their supply chains. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social responsibility</a><span class="glossdef">The idea that companies should manage their businesses not just to earn profits but to advance the well-being of society.</span></span> is the idea that companies should manage their businesses not just to earn profits but to advance the well-being of society.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p05">To demonstrate to consumers they are socially responsible, Starbucks and other companies have joined the Fair Trade movement. Members of the Fair Trade movement pay farmers and other third-world producers higher prices for their products so they don’t have to live in poverty. The prices consumers pay for products with fair-trade labels are often higher, but one Harvard study has showed that consumers expect them to be and that sales actually increased when the prices of them went up.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_009">Jeff Chu, “Are Fair-Trade Goods Recession Proof?” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, March 27, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17395.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17395.cfm</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p06">The push for environmental sustainability is also having an impact on supply chains, partly because the stricter environmental laws in many counties are demanding it. But companies are seeing the upside of producing “greener” products and disposing of them in ethical ways. First, it improves a company’s image and makes it stand out among its competitors. Second, many consumers are willing to pay more for green products, even during a recession.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_010">John Birchall, “Greener Apple Helps Clean Up,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, March 24, 2009, 11.</span> Walmart recently announced that it’s planning to require its suppliers to measure the environmental costs of producing their products.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p08">One of the drawbacks of outsourcing is the time it takes for products to make their way to the United States and into the hands of consumers. The time it takes is a big issue because it affects how responsive a company is to its customers. Retailers don’t like to wait for products. Waiting might mean their customers will shop elsewhere if they can’t find what they want. As we explained in <a class="xref" href="fwk-133234-ch08#fwk-133234-ch08">Chapter 8 "Using Marketing Channels to Create Value for Customers"</a>, for this reason and others, some companies are outsourcing their activities closer to home.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s02_p01">Your customer should ultimately be the focus of any insourcing and outsourcing decision you make. After all, unless the product gets recycled, the customer is the last link in the supply chain. Not all customers have the same product and service requirements, though. It might be acceptable for a company that sells PCs to individual consumers to outsource its tech support, perhaps to a firm in India that can perform the function at lower cost. However, a company that buys an expensive, customized computer network is probably going to want to deal directly with the maker of the product if the network goes down—not another company in another country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Similarly, if you’re producing an expensive car for Ferrari-type buyers, purchasing bargain-basement-priced parts could leave your customers dissatisfied—especially if the parts fail and their cars break down. Conversely, if you’re designing a low-end automobile, top-of-the-line parts could make it too expensive for low-end buyers. High-end car buyers are likely to demand better after-sales service than low-end car buyers, too.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s01_s02_p03">Sourcing is the process of evaluating and hiring individual businesses to supply goods and services to your business. Procurement is the process of actually purchasing those goods and services. Sourcing and procurement have become a bigger part of a supply manager’s job in recent years, in part because businesses keep becoming more specialized. Companies outsource activities to lower their costs to focus on the activities they do best. Companies face numerous tradeoffs when they outsource activities, which can include a loss of control and product-quality and safety problems. When firms that can’t resolve their supplier problems, they find other suppliers to work with or they move the activities back in-house, which is a process called insourcing. Customer should be the focus of any insourcing and outsourcing decisions companies make.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Demand Planning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p01">Imagine you are a marketing manager who has done everything in your power to help develop and promote a product—and it’s selling well. But now your company is running short of the product because the demand forecasts for it were too low. Recall that this is the scenario Nintendo faced when the Wii first came out. The same thing happened to IBM when it launched the popular ThinkPad laptop in 1992.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p02">Not only is the product shortage going to adversely affect the profitably of your company, but it’s going to adversely affect you, too. Why? Because you, as a marketing manager, probably earn either a bonus or commission from the products you work to promote, depending on how well they sell. And, of course, you can’t sell what you don’t have.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p03">As you can probably tell, the best marketing decisions and supplier selections aren’t enough if your company’s demand forecasts are wrong. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Demand planning</a><span class="glossdef">The process of estimating how much of a good or service customers will buy from you.</span></span> is the process of estimating how much of a good or service customers will buy from you. If you’re a producer of a product, this will affect not only the amount of goods and services you have to produce but also the materials you must purchase to make them. It will also affect your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">production scheduling</a><span class="glossdef">The management of the resources, events, and processes need to create an offering.</span></span>, or the management of the resources, events, and processes need to create an offering. For example, if demand is heavy, you might need your staff members to work overtime. Closely related to demand forecasting are lead times.

Lead times also have to be taken into account when a company is forecasting demand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Sourcing decisions</em>—deciding which suppliers to use—are generally made periodically. <em class="emphasis">Forecasting decisions</em> must be made more frequently—sometimes daily. One way for you to predict the demand for your product is to look at your company’s past sales. This is what most companies do. But they don’t stop there. Why? Because changes in many factors—the availability of materials to produce a product and their prices, global competition, oil prices (which affect shipping costs), the economy, and even the weather—can change the picture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p06">For example, when the economy hit the skids in 2008, the demand for many products fell. So if you had based your production, sales, and marketing forecasts on 2007 data alone, chances are your forecasts would have been wildly wrong. Do you remember when peanut butter was recalled in 2009 because of contamination? If your firm were part of the supply chain for peanut butter products, you would have needed to quickly change your forecasts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p07">The promotions you run will also affect demand for your products. Consider what happened to KFC when it first came out with its new grilled chicken product. As part of the promotion, KFC gave away coupons for free grilled chicken via Oprah.com. Just twenty-four hours after the coupons were uploaded to the Web site, KFC risked running out of chicken. Many customers were turned away. Others were given “rain checks” (certificates) they could use to get free grilled chicken later.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_013">Joe Weisenthal, “Slammed KFC ‘Scrambling to Source More Chicken,’” <em class="emphasis">The Business Insider</em>, May 6, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kfc-2009-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/kfc-2009-5</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p08">In addition to looking at the sales histories of their firms, supply chain managers also consult with marketing managers and sales executives when they are generating demand forecasts. Sales and marketing personnel know what promotions are being planned because they work more closely with customers and know what customers’ needs are and if those needs are changing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p09">Firms also look to their supply chain partners to help with their demand planning. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR)</a><span class="glossdef">A practice whereby supply chain partners share information and coordinate their operations.</span></span> is a practice whereby supply chain partners share information and coordinate their operations.

Retailers can log into Retail Link to see how well their products are selling at various Walmart stores, how soon more products need to be shipped to the company and where, how any promotions being run are affecting the profitability of their products, and so forth. Because different companies often use different information technology systems and software, Web-based tools like Retail Link are becoming a popular way for supply chain partners to interface with one another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s01_p10">Not all firms are wild about sharing every piece of information they can with their supply chains partners. Some retailers view their sales information as an asset—something they can sell to information companies like Information Resources, Inc., which provides competitive data to firms that willing to pay for it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_014">Donald J.

After all, it makes sense that a supplier will be not only more reliable but also in a better position to add value to your products if it knows what your sales, operations, and marketing plans are—and what your customers want.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s02_p02">When the attack on the World Trade Center occurred, many Americans rushed to the store to buy batteries, flashlights, American flags, canned goods, and other products in the event that the emergency signaled a much bigger attack. Target sold out of many items and could not replenish them for several days, partly because its inventory tracking system only counted up what was needed at the end of the day. Walmart, on the other hand, took count of what was needed every five minutes. Before the end of the day, Walmart had purchased enough American flags, for example, to meet demand and in so doing, completely locked up all their vendors’ flags.

On the one hand, because sales were low, firms were reluctant to hold much safety stock. Many companies, including Walmart, cut the number of brands they sold in addition to holding a smaller amount of inventory. On the other hand, because they didn’t know when business would pick up, they ran the risk of running out of products. Many firms dealt with the problem by maintaining larger amounts of key products. Companies also watched their supply chain partners struggle to survive. Forty-five percent of firms responding to one survey about the downturn reported providing financial help to their critical supply chain partners—often in the form of credit and revised payment schedules.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_018">PRTM Management Consultants, “Global Supply Chain Trends 2008–2010,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.prtm.com/uploadedFiles/Strategic_Viewpoint/Articles/Article_Content/Global_Supply_Chain_Trends_Report_%202008.pdf">http://www.prtm.com/uploadedFiles/Strategic_Viewpoint/Articles/Article_Content/Global_Supply_Chain_Trends_Report_%202008.pdf</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

And by keeping track of its customers and what they are ordering, Dell has a better idea of what they might order in the future and the types of inventory it should hold.

Electronic product codes make it possible to distinguish between two identical packs of gum. The codes contain information about when the packs of gum were manufactured, where they were shipped from, and where they were going to. Being able to tell the difference between “seemingly” identical products can help companies monitor their expiration dates if they are recalled for quality of safety reasons. EPC technology can also be used to combat “fake” products, or knockoffs, in the marketplace.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s02_s04_p05">The best marketing decisions and supplier selections aren’t enough if your company’s demand forecasts are wrong. Demand forecasting is the process of estimating how much of a good or service a customer will buy from you. If you’re a producer of a product, this will affect not only the amount of goods and services you have to produce but also the materials you must purchase to make them. Demand forecasting is part of a company’s overall inventory control activities. Inventory control is the process of ensuring your firm has an adequate amount of products and a wide enough assortment of them meet your customers’ needs. One of the goals of inventory control is to avoid stockouts without keeping too much of a product on hand. Some companies are beginning to experiment with new technologies such as electronic product codes and RFID tags in an effort to better manage their inventories and meet their customers’ needs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_p01">At times, the demand and supply for products can be unusually high. At other times, it can be unusually low. That’s why companies generally maintain a certain amount of safety stock, oftentimes in warehouses. As a business owner, it would be great if you didn’t have excess inventory you had to store in a warehouse. In an ideal world, materials or products would arrive at your facility just in time for you to assemble or sell them. Unfortunately, we don’t live in an ideal world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_p02">Toys are a good example. Most toymakers work year round to be sure they have enough toys available for sale during the holidays. However, retailers don’t want to buy a huge number of toys in July. They want to wait until November and December to buy large amounts of them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_p03">Consequently, toymakers warehouse them until that time. Likewise, during the holiday season, retailers don’t want to run out of toys, so they maintain a certain amount of safety stock in their warehouses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Some firms store products until their prices increase. Oil is an example. Speculators, including investment banks and hedge funds, have been known to buy, and hold, oil if they think its price is going to rapidly rise. Sometimes they go so far as to buy oil tankers and even entire oil fields.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_021">Robert Winnett, “Soaring Prices: Speculators Hijack the Oil Market,” <em class="emphasis">TimesOnline</em>, September 12, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article481363.ece">http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article481363.ece</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

In 2005, Walmart opened a four-million-square-foot distribution center in Texas. (Four million square feet is about the size of eighteen football fields.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_p06">Today, however, the trend has shifted back to smaller warehouses. Using smaller warehouses is a change that’s being driven by customer considerations rather than costs. The long lead times that result when companies transport products from Asia, the Middle East, and South America are forcing international manufacturers and retailers to shorten delivery times to consumers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_024">Sara Pearson Specter, “Industry Outlook: Mostly Cloudy, with a Few Bright Spots,” <em class="emphasis">Modern Materials Handling</em> 64, no. 3 (2009): 22–26.</span> Warehousing products regionally, closer to consumers, can also help a company tailor its product selection to better match the needs of customers in different regions.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Warehouses and Distribution Centers Function</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p01">So how do you begin to find a product or pallet of products in a warehouse or distribution center the size of eighteen football fields? To begin with, each type of product that is unique because of some characteristic—say, because of its manufacturer, size, color, or model—must be stored and accounted for separate from other items. To help distinguish it, its manufacturer gives it its own identification number, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SKU (stock-keeping unit)</a><span class="glossdef">A label used to distinguish a product that is unique because of some characteristic, such as manufacturer, size, color, or model.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_025">“Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU),” BusinessDictionary.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/stock-keeping-unit-SKU.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/stock-keeping-unit-SKU.html</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span> <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.10 "An Example of an SKU"</a> shows an example of a SKU that appears on a box of products. When the product enters the warehouse, it is scanned and given an “address,” or location, in the warehouse where it is stored until it is plucked from its shelf and shipped.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p02">Warehouses and distribution centers are also becoming increasingly automated and wired. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-133234-ch08#fwk-133234-ch08">Chapter 8 "Using Marketing Channels to Create Value for Customers"</a>, some warehouses use robots to picks products from shelves. At other warehouses, employees use voice-enabled headsets to pick products. Via the headsets, the workers communicate with a computer that tells them where to go and what to grab off of shelves. As a result, the employees are able to pick products more accurately than they could by looking at a sheet of paper or computer screen.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p03">The process we just described is an extremely simple explanation of a <em class="emphasis">very</em> complicated operation. The following video shows how one of Amazon.com’s distribution centers works.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p04">It’s pretty amazing when you think about how the thousands of products that come in and out of Amazon’s distribution centers every day ultimately end up in the right customer’s hands. After all, how many times have you had to look really hard to find something you put in your own closet or garage? Processing orders—order fulfillment—is a key part of the job in supply chains. Why? Because delivering what was promised, when it was promised, and the way it was promised are key drivers of customer satisfaction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_026">Sriram Thirumalai and Kingshuk K. Sinha, “Customer Satisfaction with Order Fulfillment in Retail Supply Chains: Implications of Product Type in Electronic B2C Transactions,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Operations Management</em> 23, no. 3–4 (2005): 291–303.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p05">One of the ways companies are improving their order fulfillment and other supply chain processes is by getting rid of paper systems and snail mail. So, for instance, instead of companies receiving paper orders and sending paper invoices to one another, they send and receive the documents via electronic data interchange (EDI). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Electronic data interchange (EDI)</a><span class="glossdef">A special electronic format companies use to exchange business documents from computer to computer.</span></span> is a special electronic format that companies use to exchange business documents from computer to computer.

When you get a massage, oil change, or a manicure, the services pass straight from the provider to you.

To get through crowded, narrow streets in Tokyo, Seven-Eleven Japan delivers products to its retail stores via motorcycles. In some countries, Coca-Cola delivers syrup to its bottlers via camelback. More commonly, though, products that need to be transported physically to get to customers are moved via air, rail, truck, water, or pipeline.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p01">More products are shipped by truck than by another means. Trucks can go anywhere there are roads, including straight to customer’s homes. By contrast, planes, trains, and ships are limited as to where they can go. Shipping by truck is also fast relative to other modes (except for air transportation). However, it’s also fairly expensive. Some goods—especially those that are heavy or bulky—would require so many trucks and drivers it would be economically unfeasible to use them over long distances. Coal is a good example of such a product. It would take four to five hundred trucks and drivers to haul the amount of freight that one coal train can. The amount of CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> emitted by trucks is also high relative to some of the other transportation modes, so it’s not the greenest solution.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s02_p01">International trade could scarcely be conducted without cargo shipping. Cargo ships transport “loose” cargo such as grain, coal, ore, petroleum, and other mined products. But they also transport consumer products—everything from televisions to toys. Consumer goods are often shipped in intermodal containers. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Intermodal containers</a><span class="glossdef">Metal boxes used to ship consumer goods.</span></span> are metal boxes. The largest containers are fifty-three feet long and one hundred inches tall. The biggest cargo ships are huge and carry as many 15,000 containers. By contrast, the maximum a train can carry is around 250 containers stacked on top of each other. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 9.12</a> shows a picture of a cargo ship carrying intermodal containers. The good news about shipping via waterway is that inexpensive. The bad news is that it’s very slow. In addition, many markets aren’t accessible by water, so another method of transportation has to be utilized.</p>

Brecht, “Air Transport of Perishable Products,” Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California, Publication 2168 (Oakland: ANR Communication Services): 1.</span> High-dollar goods and a small fraction of perishable goods are shipped via air. Freshly cut flowers and fresh seafood bound for sushi markets are examples of the latter. Keeping perishable products at the right temperature and humidity levels as they sit on runways and planes can be a challenge. They often have to be shipped in special types of containers with coolants. Freight forwarders are often hired to arrange the packing for perishables traveling by air and to ensure they don’t deteriorate while they are in transit. Despite the fact that it is expensive, air transportation is growing faster than any other transportation mode, thanks to companies like FedEx.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s04_p01">Railroads carry many of the same products as cargo ships—only over land. A significant percentage of intermodal containers offloaded from ships end up on railcars bound for inland destinations. The containers are then are trucked shorter distances to distribution centers, warehouses, and stores. Businesses that need to ship heavy, bulky goods often try to locate their facilities next to railroads. Lumber mills are an example.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s04_p02">In terms of speed and cost, shipping by rail falls somewhere between truck and water transportation. It’s not as slow and inexpensive as moving goods by water. However, it’s not as fast as shipping them by truck. Nor is it as expensive. So, when the price of gasoline rose in to record highs in 2008, shippers that traditionally used trucks began to look at other transportation alternatives such as rail.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s05_p01">Pipelines are generally used to transport oil, natural gas, and chemicals. Two-thirds of petroleum products are transported by pipeline, including heating oil, diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. Pipelines are costly to build, but once they are constructed, they can transport products cheaply. For example, for about one dollar you can transport a barrel of petroleum products via pipeline from Houston to New York. The oil will move three to eight miles per hour and arrive in two to three weeks depending on the size of the pipe, its pressure, and the density of the liquid.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_028">“Oil Pipelines: Small Price, Big Value,” <em class="emphasis">In the Pipe</em>, April 15, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.enewsbuilder.net/aopl/e_article000391720.cfm">http://www.enewsbuilder.net/aopl/e_article000391720.cfm</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span> Like other products, products shipped via pipelines often have to be moved using two different transportation modes. Once your barrel of oil has made it to New York, to get it to service stations, you will need to move it by rail or truck. The material in pipelines can also be stolen like other products can. In Mexico, for example, drug gangs have tapped into pipelines in remote areas and stolen millions of dollars in oil.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_029">Martha Mendoza, “Millions of Dollars in Stolen Mexican Oil Sold to U.S. Refineries,” <em class="emphasis">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, April 11, 2009, 6A.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s05_p02">Companies face different tradeoffs when choosing transportation methods. Which is most important? Speed? Cost?

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s03_s02_s05_p03">Goya Foods has many challenges due to the variety of customers it serves. The company sells more than 1,600 canned food products. Because the types of beans people prefer often depends on their cultures—whether they are of Cuban, Mexican, or Puerto Rican descent, and so forth—Goya sells thirty-eight varieties of beans alone. Almost daily, Goya’s truck drivers deliver products to tens of thousands of U.S. food stores, from supermarket chains in Texas to independent mom-and-pop bodegas in New York City. Delivering daily is more costly than dropping off jumbo shipments once a week and letting stores warehouse goods, says the company’s CEO Peter Unanue. However, it’s more of a just-in-time method that lets Goya offer stores a greater variety and ensure that products match each store’s demographics. “Pink beans might sell in New York City but not sell as well in Texas or California,” says Unanue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_030">Barbara De Lollis, “CEO Profile: At Goya, It’s All in La Familia,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Story?id=4507435&amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Story?id=4507435&amp;page=1</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_p01">As we have explained, shippers are highly anxious when their products are in transit because the merchandise is valuable and because it is exposed to more risks when it’s traveling across the country than when it’s sitting in a warehouse or store. Shippers want to know where the goods are, when they will arrive, and what kind of shape they are in. After all, they can end up in the wrong place, be damaged, or stolen. (Do you remember the 2008 incident in which when Somali pirates captured the <em class="emphasis">Maersk Alabama</em> and held its captain hostage? The cargo ship was carrying seventeen thousand metric tons of freight at the time.) The result can be unhappy customers and lost sales and profits.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Track and Trace Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s01_p01">In recent years, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">track and trace systems</a><span class="glossdef">Systems that electronically record the paths shipments take.</span></span> that electronically record the paths shipments take has become almost as important to businesses as shipping costs themselves. Being able to help trace products helps a company anticipate events that could disrupt the supply chain, including order shipping mistakes, bad weather, and accidents so they can be averted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Today most product shipments can be traced. GPS devices are sometimes placed on containers, railcars, and trucks to track the movement of expensive shipments. Tracing individual products is harder, though. Systems that utilize electronic product codes and RFID tags are not yet in widespread use. Produce is a product that’s hard to trace. You have probably noticed that the bananas, peaches, and other types of produce don’t have barcodes slapped on them. Products that are combined to make other products are also hard to trace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s01_p03">Being able to trace products is important not only to businesses but also to consumers. Consumers are more interested than ever in knowing where their products come from—particularly when there is a contamination problem with an offering. Products containing salmonella infested peanuts, tomatoes, and contaminated milk have sickened and caused the deaths of consumers and their pets across the globe. Even if the source of the contaminated product is known, consumers can’t tell exactly where the products originated from, so they stop buying them altogether. This can devastate the livelihood of producers whose products aren’t to blame.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s01_p04">Companies are working to develop systems that may one day make it possible to trace all products. The Chinese government is working toward that goal in conjunction with a Norwegian company called TraceTracker. TraceTracker is testing an online service that can identify and track each batch of every product that is merged together in the global food chain, from raw ingredients to products on supermarket shelves.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_031">Jennifer L. Schenker, “TraceTracker Tracks Food Safety on the Net,” December 4, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2008/gb2008124_501139.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2008/gb2008124_501139.htm</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reverse Logistics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s02_p01">So what happens if products end up broken or unusable as they travel through their supply chains? And what do companies do with scrap materials and other “junk” produced, such as packaging? Increasingly, firms now run products and materials such as these backward through the supply chain to extract value from them. The process is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reverse logistics</a><span class="glossdef">Running broken, defective, and scrap products backward through the supply chain so as to extract value from them.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Patagonia developed a reverse logistics systems for environmental reasons. After garments made by Patagonia are worn out, consumers can mail them to the company or return them to a Patagonia store. Patagonia then sends them to Japan to be recycled into usable fibers that are later made into new garments. The company has also convinced other clothing makers to do the same, even though it can add to the cost of products.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s02_p03">Most companies set up reverse logistics systems to “turn trash into cash.” Pittsburgh-based Genco is firm that specializes in reverse logistics. Companies like Best Buy, Sears, and Target hire Genco to find buyers for defective or broken products. A recent study suggests companies can recover up to 0.3 percent of their annual sales this way, which for Best Buy would amount to $100 million a year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn09_033">“Reverse Logistics: From Trash to Cash,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, July 24, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_31/b4094046657076.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_31/b4094046657076.htm</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

The company also creates tote bags out of plastic bags, and contracted with Target to make clocks out of old vinyl records.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s02_p05">Being able to trace products helps a company anticipate events that could disrupt the supply chain, including shipping mistakes, bad weather, and accidents so they can be averted. Most shippers have track and trace systems that can track product loads. Tracking individual products, especially after they are combined to make other products, is more difficult.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch09_s04_s02_p06">Consumers are more interested than ever in knowing where their products come from—particularly when there is a contamination problem with an offering. Reverse logistics is the process of running damaged and defective products and scrap materials backward through the supply chain to extract value from them. Companies are increasingly employing reverse logistics not only to save money but for environmental reasons.</p>
