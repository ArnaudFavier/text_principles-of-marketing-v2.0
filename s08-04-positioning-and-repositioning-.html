    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s04_p01">Why should buyers purchase your offering versus another? If your product faces competition, you will need to think about how to “position” it in the marketplace relative to competing products. After all you don’t want the product to be just another “face in the crowd” in the minds of consumers. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Positioning</a><span class="glossdef">How consumers view a product relative to the the competition.</span></span> is how consumers perceive a product relative to the competition. Companies want to have a distinctive image and offering that stands out from the competition in the minds of consumers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s04_p02">One way to position your product is to plot customer survey data on a perceptual map. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perceptual map</a><span class="glossdef">A two-dimensional graph that visually shows where a product stands, or should stand, relative to its competitors.</span></span> is a two-dimensional graph that visually shows where your product stands, or should stand, relative to your competitors, based on criteria important to buyers. The criteria can involve any number of characteristics—price, quality, level of customer service associated with the product, and so on. An example of a perceptual map is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.10 "An Example of a Perceptual Map"</a>. To avoid head-to-head competition with your competitors, you want to position your product somewhere on the map where your competitors aren’t clustered.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s04_p03">Many companies use taglines in their advertising to try to position their products in the minds of the buyer—where they want them, of course. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tagline</a><span class="glossdef">A catchphrase designed to sum up the essence of a product.</span></span> is a catchphrase designed to sum up the essence of a product. You perhaps have heard Wendy’s tagline “It’s better than fast food.” The tagline is designed to set Wendy’s apart from restaurants like McDonald’s and Burger King—to plant the idea in consumers’ heads that Wendy’s offerings are less “fast foodish,” given the bad rap fast food gets these days.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s04_p04">Sometimes firms find it advantageous to reposition their products—especially if they want the product to begin appealing to different market segments. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Repositioning</a><span class="glossdef">The process of “moving” a product to a different place in the minds of consumers.</span></span> is an effort to “move” a product to a different place in the minds of consumers. The i-house, a prefab house built by Clayton Homes, a mobile home manufacturer, is an example. According to the magazine <em class="emphasis">Popular Mechanics</em>, the i-house “looks like a house you’d order from IKEA, sounds like something designed by Apple, and consists of amenities—solar panels, tankless water heaters and rainwater collectors—that one would expect to come from an offbeat green company out of California selling to a high-end market.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_037">Ariel Schwartz, “Clayton Homes’ i-house Combines Energy Efficiency and Modular Affordability,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, May 4, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/clayton-homes-75k-energy-efficient-i-house">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/clayton-homes-75k-energy-efficient-i-house</a> (accessed December 9, 2009).</span> A Clayton Homes spokesperson says, “Are we repositioning to go after a new market?
