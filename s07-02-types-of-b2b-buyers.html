    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_p01">Business buyers can be either nonprofit or for-profit businesses. To help you get a better idea of the different types of business customers in B2B markets, we’ve put them into four basic categories: producers, resellers, governments, and institutions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Producers</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Producers</a><span class="glossdef">Companies that purchase goods and services that they transform into other products.</span></span> are companies that purchase goods and services that they transform into other products. They include both manufacturers and service providers. Procter &amp; Gamble, General Motors, McDonald’s, Dell, and Delta Airlines are examples. So are the restaurants around your campus, your dentist, your doctor, and the local tattoo parlor. All these businesses have to buy certain products to produce the goods and services they create. General Motors needs steel and hundreds of thousands of other products to produce cars. McDonald’s needs beef and potatoes. Delta Airlines needs fuel and planes. Your dentist needs drugs such as Novocain, oral tools, and X-ray machines. Your local tattoo parlor needs special inks and needles and a bright neon sign that flashes “open” in the middle of the night.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Resellers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Resellers</a><span class="glossdef">Companies that sell goods and services produced by other firms without materially changing them.</span></span> are companies that sell goods and services produced by other firms without materially changing them. They include wholesalers, brokers, and retailers. Walmart and Target are two big retailers you are familiar with. Large wholesalers, brokers, and retailers have a great deal of market power. If you can get them to buy your products, your sales can exponentially increase.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Every day, retailers flock to Walmart’s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, to try to hawk their products. But would it surprise you that not everybody wants to do business with a powerhouse like Walmart? Jim Wier, one-time CEO of the company that produces Snapper-brand mowers and snowblowers, actually took a trip to Walmart’s headquarters to <em class="emphasis">stop</em> doing business with the company. Why? Snapper products are high-end, heavy-duty products. Wier knew that Walmart had been selling his company’s products for lower and lower prices and wanted deeper and deeper discounts from Snapper. He believed Snapper products were too expensive for Walmart’s customers and always would be, unless the company started making cheaper-quality products or outsourced their manufacturing overseas, which is something he didn’t want to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s02_p03">“The whole visit to Wal-Mart’s headquarters is a great experience,” said Wier about his trip. “It’s so crowded, you have to drive around, waiting for a parking space. You have to follow someone who is leaving, walking back to their car, and get their spot. Then you go inside this building, you register for your appointment, they give you a badge, and then you wait in the pews with the rest of the peddlers, the guy with the bras draped over his shoulder.” Eventually, would-be suppliers were taken into small cubicles where they had thirty minutes to make their case. “It’s a little like going to see the principal, really,” he said.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn04_002">Charles Fishman, “The Man Who Said No to Wal-Mart,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 19, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/102/open_snapper.html?page=%200%2C2">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/102/open_snapper.html?page=0%2C2</a> (accessed December 13, 2009).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Governments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Can you guess the biggest purchaser of goods and services in the world? It is the U.S. government. It purchases everything you can imagine, from paper and fax machines to tanks and weapons, buildings, toilets for NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration), highway construction services, and medical and security services. State and local governments buy enormous amounts of products, too. They contract with companies that provide citizens with all kinds of services from transportation to garbage collection. (So do foreign governments, provinces, and localities, of course.) <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business-to-government (B2G) markets</a><span class="glossdef">Markets in which local, state, and federal governments buy products.</span></span>, or when companies sell to local, state, and federal governments, represent a major selling opportunity, even for smaller sellers. In fact, many government entities specify that their agencies must award a certain amount of business to small businesses, minority- and women-owned businesses, and businesses owned by disabled veterans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p02">There is no one central department or place in which all these products are bought and sold. Companies that want to sell to the U.S. government should first register with the Central Contractor Registry at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.CCR.gov">http://www.CCR.gov</a>. They should then consult the General Services Administration (GSA) Web site (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gsa.gov">http://www.gsa.gov</a>). The GSA helps more than two hundred federal agencies buy a wide variety of products purchased routinely. The products can include office supplies, information technology services, repair services, vehicles, and many other products purchased by agencies on a regular basis. Consequently, it is a good starting point. However, the GSA won’t negotiate a contract for the NASA toilet or a fighter jet. It sticks to routine types of purchases.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_f01">

            <img src="section_07/4ead699ec57d3fe92d95d6cad58ad4a1.jpg">
            <p class="para">The General Services Administration (GSA) is a good starting point for companies that want to do business with the federal government. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) also offers sellers a great deal of information on marketing to the government, including online courses that explain how to do it.</p>
            <div class="copyright">
                <p class="para">Source: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105344">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105344</a>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p03">The existence of the GSA doesn’t mean the agencies it works with don’t have any say over what is purchased for them. The agencies themselves have a big say, so B2B sellers need to contact them and aggressively market their products to them. After all, agencies don’t buy products, people do. Fortunately, every agency posts on the Internet a forecast of its budget, that is, what it is planning on spending money on in the coming months. The agencies even list the names, addresses, and e-mails of contact persons responsible for purchasing decisions. Many federal agencies are able to purchase as much as $25,000 of products at a time by simply using a government credit card. This fact makes them a good target for small businesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s03_p04">It’s not unusual for each agency or department to have its own procurement policies that must be followed. Would-be sellers are often asked to submit sealed bids that contain the details of what they are willing to provide the government and at what price. But contrary to popular belief, it’s not always the lowest bid that’s accepted. Would the United States want to send its soldiers to war in the cheapest planes and tanks, bearing the lowest-cost armor? Probably not. Like other buyers, government buyers look for the best value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e29.tanner_p-5254-20111102-151436-392876">Yet selling to the government is not always easy. The GSA has its own red tape, as does each government division, and many purchases come with additional regulations or specifications written into the legislation that funded them. Because many purchases can be rather large, decision cycles can be very long and involve large buying centers. Some businesses avoid selling to the government because the perceived hassle is too great to warrant the effort. Other businesses, though, realize that learning the ins and outs of government purchases can become a sustainable competitive advantage.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Institutions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Institutional markets</a><span class="glossdef">Nonprofit organizations such as the American Red Cross, churches, hospitals, charitable organizations, private colleges, and civic clubs.</span></span> include nonprofit organizations such as the American Red Cross, churches, hospitals, charitable organizations, private colleges, civic clubs, and so on. Like government and for-profit organizations, they buy a huge quantity of products and services. Holding costs down is especially important to them. The lower their costs are, the more people they can provide their services to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s04_p02">The businesses and products we have mentioned so far are broad generalizations to help you think about the various markets in which products can be sold. In addition, not all products a company buys are high dollar or complex. Businesses buy huge quantities of inexpensive products, too. McDonald’s, for example, buys a lot of toilet paper, napkins, bags, employee uniforms, and so forth. Pretty much any product you and I use is probably used for one or more business purposes (cell phones and cell-phone services, various types of food products, office supplies, and so on). Some of us own real estate, and so do many businesses. But very few of us own many of the other products businesses sell to one another: cranes, raw materials such as steel, fiber-optic cables, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s04_p03">That said, a smart B2B marketer will look at all the markets we have mentioned to see if they represent potential opportunities. The Red Cross will have no use for a fighter jet, of course. However, a company that manufactures toilet paper might be able to market it to both the Red Cross and the U.S. government. B2B opportunities abroad and online B2B markets can also be successfully pursued. We will discuss these topics later in the chapter.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Makes the Purchasing Decisions in Business Markets?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p01">Figuring out who exactly in B2B markets is responsible for what gets purchased and when often requires some detective work for marketing professionals and the salespeople they work with. Think about the college textbooks you buy. Who decides which ones ultimately are purchased by the students at your school? Do publishers send you e-mails about certain books they want you to buy? Do you see ads for different types of chemistry or marketing books in your school newspaper or on TV? Generally, you do not. The reason is that even though you buy the books, the publishers know that professors ultimately decide which textbooks are going to be used in the classroom. Consequently, B2B sellers largely concentrate their efforts on those people.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p02">That’s not to say that to some extent the publishers don’t target you. They may offer you a good deal by packaging a study guide with your textbook or some sort of learning supplement online you can purchase. They might also offer your bookstore manager a discount for buying a certain number of textbooks. However, a publishing company that focused on selling its textbooks directly to you or to a bookstore manager would go out of business. They know the true revenue generators are professors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch04_s02_s05_p03">The question is, which professors? Some professors choose their own books. Adjunct professors often don’t have a choice—their books are chosen by a course coordinator or the dean or chair of the department. Still other decisions are made by groups of professors, some of whom have more say over the final decision than others. Are you getting the picture? Figuring out where to start in B2B sales can be a little bit like a scavenger hunt.</p>
