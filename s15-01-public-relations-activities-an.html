        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_l01">
            <li>Understand the concept of public relations and why organizations allocate part of their promotional budgets to it.</li>
            <li>Understand what the different types of public relations tools are.</li>
            <li>Explain how companies use different public relations tools to their advantage.</li>
        </ol>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p01">Good public relations efforts can help a firm create rapport with its customers, promote what it has to offer, and supplement its sales efforts. PR puts a positive spin on news stories and is often perceived as more neutral and objective than other forms of promotion because much of the information is tailored to sound as if it has been created by an organization independent of the seller. Public relations materials include press releases, publicity, and news conferences. Companies also use PR to promote products and to supplement their sales efforts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p02">Many organizations that engage in public relations have in-house PR departments, media relations groups, or investor relations groups. Other organizations sometimes hire external PR firms or advertising agencies to find and create public relations opportunities for them. PR specialists must build relationships with people at different media outlets to help get their stories placed. Universities, hospitals, government organizations, and charitable organizations often hire PR people to help disseminate positive information about their services and to increase interest in what they do. As such, PR is part of a company’s promotion budget and their integrated marketing communications.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="e758.fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p02">PR specialists also help political campaign managers generate positive information in the press. PR specialists can handle crisis communication and put a positive view on situations when something bad happens to an organization or person. In foreign markets, PR agencies may help ensure product concepts are understood correctly. Getting all PR stories placed in desired media is not guaranteed. A lot of time and effort is spent getting to know people who can help publish or announce the information to the public.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_p03">Companies use a variety of tools for their public relations purposes, including annual reports, brochures and magazines for both employees and the public, Web sites to show good things they’re doing, speeches, blogs, and podcasts. Some of the most commonly used PR tools include press releases, news conferences, and publicity. Sponsorships, product placements, and social media also generate a lot of positive PR.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Press Releases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Part of a company’s public relations efforts includes putting a positive spin on news stories. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">press release</a><span class="glossdef">A news story written by an organization to promote a product, service, or person.</span></span> is a news story written by an organization to promote a product, organization, or person. Consider how much better a story or a product recommendation is likely to be perceived when the receiver thinks the content is from an objective third party rather than an organization writing about itself. Public relations personnel frequently prepare press releases in hopes that the news media will pick them up and disseminate the information to the public. However, there is no guarantee that the media will use a press release. Some of the PR opportunities that companies may seek to highlight in their press releases include charity events, awards, new products, company reports, and things they are doing to improve the environment or local community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Read the following two examples of press releases. The first story sounds like it was written by a news organization, but it was created by Apple and their public relations people to highlight the introduction of the new iPhone 3G. The second press release and picture (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_f01">Figure 12.1 "A Picture of Stubb’s Legendary Kitchen’s “Feed the World Tour”"</a>) provide an example of how a company like Stubb’s Bar-B-Q teams up with Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes, a charity that helps feed the hungry, to help feed homeless and poor people and restock food banks around the country. The story enhances the positive image of both organizations.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p09">Kurt Koegler, president of Stubb’s Legendary Kitchen, will join Alan Graham, Mobile Loaves’ founder/president, and volunteers from the company and MLF volunteers to serve the sandwiches and distribute Stubb’s T-shirts. The Austin-based company chose Mobile Loaves as its partner to kick off the “Feed the World Tour,” which is named for the stated mission of Texas Bar-B-Q legend, C.B. “Stubb” Stubblefield, who said: “I was born hungry I want to feed the world.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p10">After leaving Austin, the tour will swing through the Southeast, up the East Coast and into Washington, D.C. where the Stubb’s team will compete at the annual BBQ Battle on Pennsylvania Avenue. In each city, Stubb’s Legendary Kitchen and company president Koegler will barbecue for the homeless and help restock depleted food banks.</p>

Domino’s Pizza was forced to engage in damage control after two of its employees created a video doing disgusting things to pizzas and then posting it to YouTube. If the publicity is particularly bad, as it was for Domino’s, a company might hold a press conference or prepare a speech for the top executive to give. For example, the president of Domino’s spoke on video to try to control the damage to Domino’s business. The company then posted the following video on YouTube.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p15">Similarly, companies that move into foreign markets are sometimes perceived negatively by locals because they have little information about the firms. In India, the reputation of companies is very important to workers and their families. As a result, U.S. employers recruiting in the tech industry in India often have to work hard to make their brands and products known so people will want to work for them. The firms do so via various PR efforts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s01_p16">Just as press releases can be used to promote the good things an organization or person does, press conferences can also be held when a company is simply seeking good PR. An organization might hold a press conference to announce that it has hired new, highly sought-after executives, that it is breaking ground on a new building, or to talk about its community service projects.</p>

All the news stories talking about tickets and information about the memorial provided “free” publicity for the center and for the office supplies store, Staples, for which the center is named.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch12_s01_s02_p03">Even though sponsorships are expensive, they are growing in popularity as corporations seek ways to strengthen their corporate image, increase their brand awareness, differentiate their products, and reach their target markets. Worldwide, corporations spent over $43 billion on sponsorships in 2008;<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn12_004">“Events and Sponsorship 2008 Marketing Fact Book,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing News</em>, July 15, 2008, 26.</span> however, the recession has taken a toll and the new stadium for the Dallas Cowboys still doesn’t have a sponsor with naming rights. Over two-thirds of the sponsorships in North America are for sports, followed by entertainment (e.g., music and performing arts) and causes (e.g., the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and “alternative spring breaks” for college students). Other organizations and structures, such as buildings and bridges, may seek sponsorships as a means of generating revenue. Imagine how many people drive across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York or the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and how much awareness an organization would get if they were allowed to pay to have their name on either of the bridges.</p>

The airline also donates frequent flier miles to the cause. Yoplait Yogurt donates money for breast cancer research for every pink lid that is submitted.
