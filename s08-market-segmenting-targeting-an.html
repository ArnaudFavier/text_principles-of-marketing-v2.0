    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_p01">Suppose you have an idea for a great new offering you hope will become a hot seller. Before you quit your day job, you’ll need to ask yourself, “Does my idea satisfy consumers’ needs and add value to existing products?” “Who’s going to buy my product?” and “Will there be enough of these people to make it worth my while?”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_p02">Certain people will be more interested in what you plan to offer than others. Not everyone needs homeowners’ insurance, not everyone needs physical therapy services, and not every organization needs to purchase vertical lathes or CT scanners. Among those that do, some will buy a few, and a few will buy many. In terms of potential buyers, not all of them are “created equal.” Some customers are more equal than others, however. A number of people might be interested in your product idea if it satisfies a need, adds value, is priced right, or if they are aware when your product exists in the marketplace.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_p03">Your goal is to figure out which people and organizations are interested in your product ideas. To do this you will need to divide or segment the people and organizations into different groups of potential buyers with similar characteristics. This process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market segmentation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of breaking down all consumers into groups of potential buyers with similar characteristics.</span></span> and involves asking the question, <em class="emphasis">What groups of buyers are similar enough that the same product or service will appeal to all of them</em>?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_001">Bruce R. Barringer and Duane Ireland, <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneurship: Successfully Launching New Ventures</em>, 3rd ed.

You need to get the biggest bang for your buck by focusing on those people you truly have a shot at selling to and tailoring your offering toward them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_p02">Automaker Henry Ford was very successful at both mass production and mass marketing. Ford pioneered the modern-day assembly line early in the twentieth century, which helped him cost-effectively pump out huge numbers of identical Model T automobiles. They came in only one color: black. “Any customer can have a car painted any color he wants, so long as it is black,” Ford used to joke. He also advertised in every major newspaper and persuaded all kinds of publications to carry stories about the new, inexpensive cars. By 1918, half of all cars on America’s roads were Model Ts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_003">Henry Ford, <em class="emphasis">My Life and Work</em> (Garden City, NY: Garden City Publishing Co., 1922), 72.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_p03">Then Alfred P. Sloan, the head of General Motors (GM), appeared on the scene. Sloan began to segment consumers in the automobile market—to divide them up by the prices they wanted to pay and the different cars they wanted to buy. The idea was to offer a car for every target market or for every income level. His efforts were successful, and in the 1950s, GM overtook Ford as the nation’s top automaker.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_004">José María Manzanedo, “Market Segmentation Strategies. How to Maximize Opportunities on the Potential Market,” February 20, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daemonquest.com/en/research_and_insight/2006/10/11/market_segmentation_strategies_how_to_maximize_opportunities_on_the_potential_market">http://www.daemonquest.com/en/research_and_insight/2006/10/11/market_segmentation_strategies_how_to_maximize_opportunities_on_the_potential_market</a> (accessed December 1, 2009).</span> (You might be interested to know that before GM declared bankruptcy in 2009, it was widely believed the automaker actually had too many car models. After eliminating many models including Pontiac and Oldsmobile, General Motors made a turnaround and posted a large profit for 2011.)</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Benefits of Segmenting and Targeting Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_p01">The story of General Motors raises an important point, which is that segmenting and targeting markets doesn’t necessarily mean “skinnying down” the number of your customers. In fact, it can help you enlarge your customer base by giving you information with which to successfully adjust some component of your offering—the offering itself, its price, the way you service and market it. More specifically, the process can help you do the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Avoid head-on competition with other firms trying to capture the same customers.</li>
            <li>Develop new offerings and expand profitable brands and products lines.</li>
            <li>Remarket older, less-profitable products and brands.</li>
            <li>Identify early adopters.</li>
            <li>Redistribute money and sales efforts to focus on your most profitable customers.</li>
            <li>Retain “at-risk” customers in danger of defecting to your competitors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_p02">The trend today is toward more precise, targeted marketing. Figuring out “who’s who” in terms of your customers involves some detective work, though—often market research. A variety of tools and research techniques can be used to segment markets. Government agencies, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, collect and report vast amounts of population information and economic data that can reveal changing consumption trends. Technology is also making it easier for even small companies and entrepreneurs to gather information about potential customers. For example, the online game company GamePUMA.com originally believed its target market consisted of U.S. customers, but when the firm looked more closely at who was downloading games from its Web site, they were people from all over the globe. With the increased use of social media, companies are able to get information on consumers’ search behavior. Loyalty cards that consumers scan at many grocery and drug stores provide an incredible amount of information on consumers’ buying behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_p04">The great product idea you had? Companies are now using the Internet to track people’s Web browsing patterns and segment them into target groups. Even small businesses are able to do this cost-effectively because they don’t need their own software and programs. They can simply sign up online for products like Google’s AdSense and AdWords programs. You can locate potential customers by looking at blog sites and discussion forums on the Web. Big-boards.com has thousands of discussion forums you can mine to find potential customers interested in your product. Do you have a blog? Go to BlogPoll.com, and you can embed a survey in your blog to see what people think of your idea. If you have a Web site, you can download an application onto your iPhone that will give you up-to-the-minute information and statistics on your site’s visitors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_p05">Getting a read on potential target markets doesn’t necessarily have to involve technology. Your own personal experience and talking to would-be buyers is an important part of the puzzle. Go where you think would-be buyers go—restaurants, malls, gyms, subways, grocery stores, daycare centers, and offices—and ask questions to find out what they do during the day, what they talk about, what products or services do you see them using, and do they seem to be having an enjoyable experience when using those products or are they frustrated?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s01_p06">Healthy Choice frozen dinners were conceived as a result of questioning potential customers. The food-maker ConAgra launched the dinners in the late 1980s after its CEO, Charlie Harper, suffered a heart attack. One day a colleague complimented Harper on his wife’s tasty low-fat turkey stew. That’s when Harper realized there were people like him who wanted healthy convenience foods, so he began talking to them about what they wanted. Two years after the Healthy Choice line was launched, it controlled 10 percent of the frozen-dinner market by concentrating on the health conscious segment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_005">John Birchall, “Out to Launch in a Downturn,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, June 4, 2009, 10.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p01">Finding and attracting new customers is generally far more difficult than retaining your current customers. Think about how much time and energy you spend when you switch your business from one firm to another, even when you’re buying something as simple as a haircut. If you aren’t happy with your hair stylist and want to find a new hairdresser, you first have to talk to people with haircuts you like or read reviews of salons. Once you decide on a particular salon, you have to find it and explain to the new hairdresser how you want your hair cut and hope he or she gets it right. You also have to figure out what type of credit cards the  new salon will  accept and whether tips can be put on your  credit card.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Finding new customers, getting to know them, and figuring out what they really want is also a difficult process, one that’s fraught with trial and error. That’s why it’s so important to get to know, form close relationships, and focus selling efforts on current customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_006">John Birchall, “Value Trend Tests Brand Loyalty,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, March 31, 2009, 12.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p04">In 2009, Backroads, a California company focused on adventure-based travel increased its revenues by creating a personalized marketing campaign for people who had done business with them in the past. Backroads looked at customers’ past purchases, the seasons in which they took their trips, the levels of activity associated with them, and whether or not the customers tended to vacation with children. Based on their findings, Backroads created three relevant trip suggestions for each customer and sent postcards and e-mails with links to customized Web pages reminding each customer of the trips he/she had previously booked with Backroads and suggesting new ones. “In terms of past customers, it was like off-the-charts better [than past campaigns],” says Massimo Prioreschi, the vice president of Backroads’ sales and marketing group.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_007">“Lift Sales with Personalized, Multi-channel Messages: 6 Steps,” July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=31299">http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=31299</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p05">In addition to studying their buying patterns, firms also try to get a better understanding of their customers by surveying them or hiring marketing research firms to do so or by utilizing loyalty programs. (A good source for finding marketing research companies is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenbook.org">http://www.greenbook.org</a>.) For example, if you sign up to become a frequent flier with a certain airline, the airline will likely ask you a number of questions about your likes and dislikes. This information will then be entered into a customer relationship management (CRM) system, and you might be e-mailed special deals based on the routes you tend to fly. British Airways goes so far as to track the magazines its most elite fliers like to read so the publications are available to them on its planes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e365.fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p13">Twitter is another way companies are keeping in touch with their customers and boosting their revenues. When the homemaking maven Martha Stewart schedules a book signing, she tweets her followers, and voilà, many of them show up at the bookstore she’s appearing at to buy copies. Finding ways to interact with customers that they enjoy—whether it’s meeting or “tweeting” them, or putting on events and tradeshows they want to attend—is the key to forming relationships with them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p06">Many firms, even small ones, are using Facebook to develop closer relationships with their customers. Hansen Cakes, a Beverly Hills (California) bakery, has about two thousand customers who visit its Facebook page. During her downtime at the bakery, employee Suzi Finer posts “cakes updates” and photos of the goodies she’s working on to the site. Along with information about the cakes, Finer extends special offers to customers and mixes in any gossip about Hollywood celebrities she’s spotted in the area. After Hansen Cakes launched its Facebook page, the bakery’s sales shot up 15–20 percent. “And that’s during the recession,” notes Finer, who is obviously proud of the results she’s gotten.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_008">Jefferson Graham, “Cade Decoratero Finds Twitter a Sweet Recipe for Success,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, April 1, 2009, 5B.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p07">Regardless of how well companies know their customers, it’s important to remember that some customers are highly profitable, others aren’t, and others actually end up costing your firm money to serve. Consequently, you will want to interact with some customers more than others. Believe it or not, some firms deliberately “untarget” unprofitable customers. Best Buy got a lot of attention (not all of it good) when it was discovered they had categorized its buyers into “personas,” or types of buyers, and created customized sales approaches for each. For example, an upper-middle-class woman was referred to as a “Jill.” A young urban man was referred to as a “Buzz.” Pesky, bargain-hunting customers that Best Buy couldn’t make much of a profit from were referred to as “devils” and taken off the company’s mailing lists.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_009">Meg Marco, “LEAKS: Best Buy’s Internal Customer Profiling Document,” <em class="emphasis">The Consumerist</em>, March 18, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://consumerist.com/368894/leaks-best-buys-internal-customer-%20profiling-document">http://consumerist.com/368894/leaks-best-buys-internal-customer-profiling-document</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p09">The knife cuts both ways, though. Not all firms are equal in the minds of consumers, who will choose to do business with some companies rather than others. To consumers, market segmentation means: meet <em class="emphasis">my</em> needs—give me what <em class="emphasis">I</em> want.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_010">“Market Segmentation,” <em class="emphasis">The Market Segmentation Company</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketsegmentation.co.uk/segmentation_tmsc.htm">http://www.marketsegmentation.co.uk/segmentation_tmsc.htm</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s01_s02_p11">One-to-one marketing is an idea proposed by Don Peppers and Martha Rogers in their 1994 book <em class="emphasis">The One to One Future</em>. The book described what life would be like after mass marketing. We would all be able to get exactly what we want from sellers, and our relationships with them would be collaborative, rather than adversarial. Are we there yet? Not quite, but it does seem to be the direction the trend toward highly targeted marketing is leading.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_p01">Sellers can choose to pursue consumer markets, business-to-business (B2B) markets, or both. Consequently, one obvious way to begin the segmentation process is to segment markets into these two types of groups.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_p02">Different factors influence consumers to buy certain things. Many of the same factors can also be used to segment customers. A firm will often use multiple <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">segmentation bases</a><span class="glossdef">Criteria used to classify and divide buyers into different groups.</span></span>, or criteria to classify buyers, to get a fuller picture of its customers and create real value for them. Each variable adds a layer of information. Think of it as being similar to the way in which your professor builds up information on a PowerPoint slide to the point at which you are able to understand the material being presented.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_p03">There are all kinds of characteristics you can use to slice and dice a market. “Big-and-tall” stores cater to the segment of population that’s larger sized. What about people with wide or narrow feet, or people with medical conditions, or certain hobbies? Next, we look primarily at the ways in which consumer markets can be segmented. Later in the chapter, we’ll look at the ways in which B2B markets can be segmented.</p>

Notice that the characteristics fall into one of four segmentation categories: <em class="emphasis">behavioral</em>, <em class="emphasis">demographic</em>, <em class="emphasis">geographic</em>, or <em class="emphasis">psychographic</em>. We’ll discuss each of these categories in a moment. For now, you can get a rough idea of what the categories consist of by looking at them in terms of how marketing professionals might answer the following questions:</p>

Take toothpaste, for example. Which benefit is most important to you when you buy a toothpaste: The toothpaste’s price, ability to whiten your teeth, fight tooth decay, freshen your breath, or something else? Perhaps it’s a combination of two or more benefits. If marketing professionals know what those benefits are, they can then tailor different toothpaste offerings to you (and other people like you). For example, Colgate 2-in-1 Toothpaste &amp; Mouthwash, Whitening Icy Blast is aimed at people who want the benefits of both fresher breath and whiter teeth.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Another way in which businesses segment buyers is by their usage rates—that is, how often, if ever, they use certain products. Harrah’s, an entertainment and gaming company, gathers information about the people who gamble at its casinos. High rollers, or people who spend a lot of money, are considered “VIPs.” VIPs get special treatment, including a personal “host” who looks after their needs during their casino visits. Companies are interested in frequent users because they want to reach other people like them. They are also keenly interested in nonusers and how they can be persuaded to use products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s02_p03">The way in which people use products is also be a basis for segmentation. Avon Skin So Soft was originally a beauty product, but after Avon discovered that some people were using it as a mosquito repellant, the company began marketing it for that purpose. Eventually, Avon created a separate product called Skin So Soft Bug Guard, which competes with repellents like Off! Similarly, Glad, the company that makes plastic wrap and bags, found out customers were using its Press’n Seal wrap in ways the company could never have imagined. The personnel in Glad’s marketing department subsequently launched a Web site called 1000uses.com that contains both the company’s and consumers’ use tips. Some of the ways in which people use the product are pretty unusual, as evidenced by the following comment posted on the site: “I have a hedgehog who likes to run on his wheel a lot. After quite a while of cleaning a gross wheel every morning, I got the tip to use ‘Press’n Seal wrap’ on his wheel, making clean up much easier! My hedgie can run all he wants, and I don’t have to think about the cleanup. Now we’re both GLAD!”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s02_p04">Although we doubt Glad will ever go to great lengths to segment the Press ’n Seal market by hedgehog owners, the firm has certainly gathered a lot of good consumer insight about the product and publicity from its 1000uses.com Web site. (Incidentally, one rainy day, the author of this chapter made “rain boots” out of Press ’n Seal for her dog. But when she later tried to tear them off of the dog’s paws, he bit her. She is now thinking of trading him in for a hedgehog.)</p>

Pepsi Throwback and Mountain Dew Throwback, which are made with cane sugar—like they were “back in the good old days”—instead of corn syrup, are examples.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_012">Barry Schlacter, “Sugar-Sweetened Soda Is Back in the Mainstream,” <em class="emphasis">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, April 22, 2009, 1C, 5C.</span> Marketing professionals believe they appealed to baby boomers because they reminded them of better times—times when they didn’t have to worry about being laid off, about losing their homes, or about their retirement funds and pensions drying up.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s01_p03">Baby boomers are aging and the size of the group will eventually decline. By contrast, the members of Generation Y have a lifetime of buying still ahead of them, which translates to a lot of potential customer lifetime value (CLV), the amount a customer will spend on a particular brand over his/her lifetime, for marketers if they can capture this group of buyers. However, a recent survey found that the latest recession had forced teens to change their spending habits and college plans and that roughly half of older Generation Yers reported they had no savings.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_013">“Generation Y Lacking Savings,” <em class="emphasis">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, September 13, 2009, 2D.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s01_p04">So which group or groups should your firm target? Although it’s hard to be all things to all people, many companies try to broaden their customer bases by appealing to multiple generations so they don’t lose market share when demographics change. Several companies have introduced lower-cost brands targeting Generation Xers, who have less spending power than boomers. For example, kitchenware and home-furnishings company Williams-Sonoma opened the Elm Street chain, a less-pricey version of the Pottery Barn franchise. The Starwood hotel chain’s W hotels, which feature contemporary designs and hip bars, are aimed at Generation Xers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_014">Richard K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s01_p05">The video game market is very proud of the fact that along with Generation X and Generation Y, many older Americans still play video games. (You probably know some baby boomers who own a Nintendo Wii.) Products and services in the spa market used to be aimed squarely at adults, but not anymore. Parents are now paying for their tweens to get facials, pedicures, and other pampering in numbers no one in years past could have imagined.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s01_p06">As early as the 1970s, U.S. automakers found themselves in trouble because of changing demographic trends. Many of the companies’ buyers were older Americans inclined to “buy American.” These people hadn’t forgotten that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor during World War II and weren’t about to buy Japanese vehicles, but younger Americans were. Plus, Japanese cars had developed a better reputation. Despite the challenges U.S. automakers face today, they have taken great pains to cater to the “younger” generation—today’s baby boomers who don’t think of themselves as being old. If you are a car buff, you perhaps have noticed that the once-stodgy Cadillac now has a sportier look and stiffer suspension. Likewise, the Chrysler 300 looks more like a muscle car than the old Chrysler Fifth Avenue your great-grandpa might have driven.</p>

General Motors (GM) has sought to revamp the century-old company by hiring a new younger group of managers—managers who understand how Generation X and Y consumers are wired and what they want. “If you’re going to appeal to my daughter, you’re going to have to be in the digital world,” explained one GM vice president.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_015">Bob Cox, “GM Hopes Its New Managers Will Energize It,” <em class="emphasis">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, August 29, 2009, 1C–4C.</span></p>

People in these generations not only tend to ignore traditional advertising but also are downright annoyed by it. To market to Scion drivers, who are generally younger, Toyota created Scion Speak, a social networking site where they can communicate, socialize, and view cool new models of the car. Online events such as the fashion shows broadcast over the Web are also getting the attention of younger consumers, as are text, e-mail, and Twitter messages they can sign up to receive so as to get coupons, cash, and free merchandise.

But would you change your mind if you knew that baby boomers account for 50 percent of all consumer spending in the United States? Americans <em class="emphasis">over</em> sixty-five now control nearly three-quarters of the net worth of U.S. households; this group spends $200 billion a year on major “discretionary” (optional) purchases such as luxury cars, alcohol, vacations, and financial products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_016">Tim Reisenwitz, Rajesh Iyer, David B.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p02">Income is used as a segmentation variable because it indicates a group’s buying power and may partially reflect their education levels, occupation, and social classes. Higher education levels usually result in higher paying jobs and greater social status. The makers of upscale products such as Rolexes and Lamborghinis aim their products at high-income groups. However, a growing number of firms today are aiming their products at lower-income consumers. The fastest-growing product in the financial services sector is prepaid debit cards, most of which are being bought and used by people who don’t have bank accounts. Firms are finding that this group is a large, untapped pool of customers who tend to be more brand loyal than most. If you capture enough of them, you can earn a profit.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_017">Constantine von Hoffman, “For Some Marketers, Low Income Is Hot,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, September 11, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://cfsinnovation.com/content/some-marketers-low-income-hot">http://cfsinnovation.com/content/some-marketers-low-income-hot</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span> Based on the targeted market, businesses can determine the location and type of stores where they want to sell their products.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s03_p01">Gender is another way to segment consumers. Men and women have different needs and also shop differently. Consequently, the two groups are often, but not always, segmented and targeted differently. Marketing professionals don’t stop there, though. For example, because women make many of the purchases for their households, market researchers sometimes try to further divide them into subsegments. (Men are also often subsegmented.) For women, those segments might include <em class="emphasis">stay-at-home</em> housewives, <em class="emphasis">plan-to-work</em> housewives, <em class="emphasis">just-a-job</em> working women, and <em class="emphasis">career-oriented</em> working women. Research has found that women who are solely homemakers tend to spend more money, perhaps because they have more time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s03_p02">In addition to segmenting by gender, market researchers might couple gender with marital status and other demographic characteristics.

For example, if you have no children, your demand for pediatric services (medical care for children) is likely to be slim to none, but if you have children, your demand might be very high because children frequently get sick. You may be part of the target market not only for pediatric services but also for a host of other products, such as diapers, daycare,  children’s clothing, entertainment services, and educational products. A secondary segment of interested consumers might be grandparents who are likely to spend less on day-to-day childcare items but more on special-occasion gifts for children. Many markets are segmented based on the special events in people’s lives. Think about brides (and want-to-be brides) and all the products targeted at them, including Web sites and television shows such as <em class="emphasis">Say Yes to the Dress</em>, <em class="emphasis">My Fair Wedding</em>, <em class="emphasis">Platinum Weddings</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Bridezillas</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s04_p02">Resorts also segment vacationers depending on where they are in their family life cycles. When you think of family vacations, you probably think of Disney resorts. Some vacation properties, such as Sandals, exclude children from some of their resorts. Perhaps they do so because some studies show that the market segment with greatest financial potential is married couples without children.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_019">Brian J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s04_p03">Keep in mind that although you might be able to isolate a segment in the marketplace, including one based on family life cycle, you can’t make assumptions about what the people in it will want. Just like people’s demographics change, so do their tastes. For example, over the past few decades U.S. families have been getting smaller. Households with a single occupant are more commonplace than ever, but until recently, that hasn’t stopped people from demanding bigger cars (and more of them) as well as larger houses, or what some people jokingly refer to as “McMansions.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s03_s04_p04">The trends toward larger cars and larger houses appear to be reversing. High energy costs, the credit crunch, and concern for the environment are leading people to demand smaller houses. To attract people such as these, D. R.

If you’ve visited a grocery store that caters to a different ethnic group than your own, you were probably surprised to see the types of products sold there. It’s no secret that the United States is becoming—and will continue to become—more diverse. Hispanic Americans are the largest and the fastest-growing minority in the United States. Companies are going to great lengths to court this once overlooked group. In California, the health care provider Kaiser Permanente runs television ads letting members of this segment know that they can request Spanish-speaking physicians and that Spanish-speaking nurses, telephone operators, and translators are available at all of its clinics.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_020">Eric N.

Consequently, painting each group with a broad brush would leave you with an incomplete picture of your buyers.

Before you open the store, you will probably want to do some research to determine which geographical areas have the best potential. For instance, if your business is a high-end restaurant, should it be located near the local college or country club? If you sell ski equipment, you probably will want to locate your shop somewhere in the vicinity of a mountain range where there is skiing. You might see a snowboard shop in the same area but probably not a surfboard shop. By contrast, a surfboard shop is likely to be located along the coast, but you probably would not find a snowboard shop on the beach.</p>

McDonald’s generally won’t put a store in a town of fewer than five thousand people. However, this is prime turf for the “DQ”— because it doesn’t have to compete with bigger franchises like McDonald’s.</p>

Chances are you won’t be able to find the same heavy winter coat you see at a Walmart in Montana at a Walmart in Florida because of the climate differences between the two places. Market researchers also look at migration patterns to evaluate opportunities. TexMex restaurants are more commonly found in the southwestern United States. However, northern states are now seeing more of them as more people of Hispanic descent move northward.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Segmenting by Psychographics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s05_p01">If your offering fulfills the needs of a specific demographic group, then the demographic can be an important basis for identifying groups of consumers interested in your product. What if your product crosses several market segments? For example, the group of potential consumers for cereal could be “almost” everyone although groups of people may have different needs with regard to their cereal. Some consumers might be interested in the fiber, some consumers (especially children) may be interested in the prize that comes in the box, other consumers may be interested in the added vitamins, and still other consumers may be interested in the type of grains. Associating these specific needs with consumers in a particular demographic group could be difficult. Marketing professionals want to know <em class="emphasis">why</em> consumers behave the way they do, what is of high priority to them, or how they rank the importance of specific buying criteria. Think about some of your friends who seem a lot like you. Have you ever gone to their homes and been shocked by their lifestyles and how vastly different they are from yours? Why are their families so much different from yours?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s05_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Psychographic segmentation</a><span class="glossdef">Segmenting people by their activities, interests, opinion, attitudes, values, and lifestyles.</span></span> can help fill in some of the blanks. Psychographic information is frequently gathered via extensive surveys that ask people about their activities, interests, opinion, attitudes, values, and lifestyles. One of the most well-known psychographic surveys is VALS (which originally stood for “Values, Attitudes, and Lifestyles”) and was developed by a company called SRI International in the late 1980s. SRI asked thousands of Americans the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with questions similar to the following: “My idea of fun at a national park would be to stay at an expensive lodge and dress up for dinner” and “I could stand to skin a dead animal.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_025">James H. Donnelly, preface to <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em>, 9th ed., by J. Paul Peter (New York: McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002), 79.</span> Based on their responses to different questions, consumers were divided up into the following categories, each characterized by certain buying behaviors.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Innovators.</strong> Innovators are successful, sophisticated, take-charge people with high self-esteem. Because they have such abundant resources, they exhibit all three primary motivations in varying degrees. They are change leaders and are the most receptive to new ideas and technologies. Innovators are very active consumers, and their purchases reflect cultivated tastes for upscale, niche products and services. Image is important to Innovators, not as evidence of status or power but as an expression of their taste, independence, and personality. Innovators are among the established and emerging leaders in business and government, yet they continue to seek challenges. Their lives are characterized by variety. Their possessions and recreation reflect a cultivated taste for the finer things in life.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Thinkers.</strong> Thinkers are motivated by ideals. They are mature, satisfied, comfortable, and reflective people who value order, knowledge, and responsibility. They tend to be well educated and actively seek out information in the decision-making process. They are well informed about world and national events and are alert to opportunities to broaden their knowledge. Thinkers have a moderate respect for the status quo institutions of authority and social decorum but are open to consider new ideas. Although their incomes allow them many choices, Thinkers are conservative, practical consumers; they look for durability, functionality, and value in the products they buy.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Achievers.</strong> Motivated by the desire for achievement, Achievers have goal-oriented lifestyles and a deep commitment to career and family. Their social lives reflect this focus and are structured around family, their place of worship, and work. Achievers live conventional lives, are politically conservative, and respect authority and the status quo. They value consensus, predictability, and stability over risk, intimacy, and self-discovery. With many wants and needs, Achievers are active in the consumer marketplace. Image is important to Achievers; they favor established, prestige products and services that demonstrate success to their peers. Because of their busy lives, they are often interested in a variety of timesaving devices.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Experiencers.</strong> Experiencers are motivated by self-expression. As young, enthusiastic, and impulsive consumers, Experiencers quickly become enthusiastic about new possibilities but are equally quick to cool. They seek variety and excitement, savoring the new, the offbeat, and the risky. Their energy finds an outlet in exercise, sports, outdoor recreation, and social activities. Experiencers are avid consumers and spend a comparatively high proportion of their income on fashion, entertainment, and socializing. Their purchases reflect the emphasis they place on looking good and having “cool” stuff.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Believers.</strong> Like Thinkers, Believers are motivated by ideals. They are conservative, conventional people with concrete beliefs based on traditional, established codes: family, religion, community, and the nation. Many Believers express moral codes that are deeply rooted and literally interpreted. They follow established routines, organized in large part around home, family, community, and social or religious organizations to which they belong. As consumers, Believers are predictable; they choose familiar products and established brands. They favor American products and are generally loyal customers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Strivers.</strong> Strivers are trendy and fun loving. Because they are motivated by achievement, Strivers are concerned about the opinions and approval of others. Money defines success for Strivers, who don’t have enough of it to meet their desires. They favor stylish products that emulate the purchases of people with greater material wealth. Many see themselves as having a job rather than a career, and a lack of skills and focus often prevents them from moving ahead. Strivers are active consumers because shopping is both a social activity and an opportunity to demonstrate to peers their ability to buy. As consumers, they are as impulsive as their financial circumstance will allow.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Makers.</strong> Like Experiencers, Makers are motivated by self-expression. They express themselves and experience the world by working on it—building a house, raising children, fixing a car, or canning vegetables—and have enough skill and energy to carry out their projects successfully. Makers are practical people who have constructive skills and value self-sufficiency. They live within a traditional context of family, practical work, and physical recreation and have little interest in what lies outside that context. Makers are suspicious of new ideas and large institutions such as big business. They are respectful of government authority and organized labor but resentful of government intrusion on individual rights. They are unimpressed by material possessions other than those with a practical or functional purpose. Because they prefer value to luxury, they buy basic products.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Survivors.</strong> Survivors live narrowly focused lives. With few resources with which to cope, they often believe that the world is changing too quickly. They are comfortable with the familiar and are primarily concerned with safety and security. Because they must focus on meeting needs rather than fulfilling desires, Survivors do not show a strong primary motivation. Survivors are cautious consumers. They represent a very modest market for most products and services. They are loyal to favorite brands, especially if they can purchase them at a discount.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_026">“U.S. Framework and VALS™ Type,” <em class="emphasis">Strategic Business Insights</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml">http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml</a> (accessed December 2, 2009).</span>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Segmentation in B2B Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s06_p01">Many of the same bases used to segment consumer markets are also used to segment B2B markets. For example, Goya Foods is a U.S. food company that sells different ethnic products to grocery stores, depending on the demographic groups the stores serve—Hispanic, Mexican, or Spanish. Likewise, B2B sellers often divide their customers by geographic areas and tailor their products to them accordingly. Segmenting by behavior is common as well. B2B sellers frequently divide their customers based on their product usage rates. Customers that order many goods and services from a seller often receive special deals and are served by salespeople who call on them in person. By contrast, smaller customers are more likely to have to rely on a firm’s Web site, customer service people, and salespeople who call on them by telephone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s06_p02">Researchers Matthew Harrison, Paul Hague, and Nick Hague have theorized that there are fewer behavioral and needs-based segments in B2B markets than in business-to-consumer (B2C) markets for two reasons: (1) business markets are made up of a few hundred customers whereas consumer markets can be made up of hundreds of thousands of customers, and (2) businesses aren’t as fickle as consumers. Unlike consumers, they aren’t concerned about their social standing or influenced by their families and peers. Instead, businesses are concerned solely with buying products that will ultimately increase their profits. According to Harrison, Hague, and Hague, the behavioral, or needs-based, segments in B2B markets include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s06_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">A price-focused segment</strong> is composed of small companies that have low profit margins and regard the good or service being sold as not being strategically important to their operations.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">A quality and brand-focused segment</strong> is composed of firms that want the best possible products and are prepared to pay for them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">A service-focused segment</strong> is composed of firms that demand high-quality products and have top-notch delivery and service requirements.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">A partnership-focused segment</strong> is composed of firms that seek trust and reliability on the part of their suppliers and see them as strategic partners.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_028">Matthew Harrison, Paul Hague, and Nick Hague, “Why Is Business-to-Business Marketing Special?”(whitepaper), <em class="emphasis">B2B International</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.b2binternational.com/library/whitepapers/whitepapers04.php">http://www.b2binternational.com/library/whitepapers/whitepapers04.php</a> (accessed January 27, 2010).</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s06_p04">B2B sellers, like B2C sellers, are exploring new ways to reach their target markets. Trade shows and direct mail campaigns are two traditional ways of reaching B2B markets. Now, however, firms are finding they can target their B2B customers more cost-effectively via e-mail campaigns, search-engine marketing, and “fan pages” on social networking sites like Facebook. Companies are also creating blogs with cutting-edge content about new products and business trends of interest to their customers. For a fraction of the cost of attending a trade show to exhibit their products, B2B sellers are holding Webcasts and conducting online product demonstrations for potential customers.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s02_s06_p05">Segmentation bases are criteria used to classify buyers. The main types of buyer characteristics used to segment consumer markets are behavioral, demographic, geographic, and psychographic. Behavioral segmentation divides people and organization into groups according to how they behave with or toward products. Segmenting buyers by personal characteristics such as their age, income, ethnicity, family size, and so forth is called demographic segmentation. Geographic segmentation involves segmenting buyers based on where they live. Psychographic segmentation seeks to differentiate buyers based on their activities, interests, opinions, attitudes, values, and lifestyles. Oftentimes a firm uses multiple bases to get a fuller picture of its customers and create value for them. Marketing professionals develop consumer insight when they gather both quantitative and qualitative information about their customers. Many of the same bases used to segment consumer markets are used to segment business-to-business (B2B) markets. However, there are generally fewer behavioral-based segments in B2B markets.</p>

However, because the country’s population is so large (nearly 1.5 billion people), more cars are sold in China than in Europe (and in the United States, depending on the month). Three billion people in the world own cell phones.

<strong class="emphasis bold">It is not already swamped by competitors, or you have found a way to stand out in a crowd.</strong> IBM used to make PCs. However, after the marketplace became crowded with competitors, IBM sold the product line to a Chinese company called Lenovo.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">The company has the resources to compete in it.</strong> You might have a great idea to compete in the wind-power market. However, it is a business that is capital intensive. What this means is that you will either need a lot of money or must be able to raise it. You might also have to compete with the likes of T.

Mass marketing is also efficient because you don’t have to tailor any part of the offering for different groups of consumers, which is more work and costs more money.

For example, the growing number of people too old to travel have the option of moving into one of Marriott’s “Senior Living Services” facilities, which cater to retirees who need certain types of care. A multisegment strategy can also help companies weather an economic downturn by allowing customers to trade up or down among brands and products. Suppose you take a pay cut and can’t afford to stay at Marriott’s Ritz-Carlton hotels anymore. A room at a JW Marriott—the most luxurious of the Marriott-brand hotels but cheaper than the Ritz—is available to you. A multisegment strategy can also help companies deal with the product life cycle issues. If one brand or product is “dying out,” the company has others to compete.</p>

It was originally used to segment voters during elections, including the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

One company that compiles information such as this is Acxiom.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p01">Firms that compete in the global marketplace can use any combination of the segmenting strategies or none at all. A microcosm of the targeting strategies used in global markets is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_f01">Figure 5.9 "Targeting Strategies Used in Global Markets"</a>. If you’re a seller of a metal like iron ore, you might sell the same product across the entire world via a metals broker. The broker would worry about communicating with customers around the world and devising different marketing campaigns for each of them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p02">Most companies, however, tailor their offerings to some extent to meet the needs of different buyers around the world. For example, Mattel sells Barbie dolls all around the world—but not the same Barbie. Mattel has created thousands of different Barbie offerings designed to appeal to all kinds of people in different countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p03">Pizza Hut has franchises around the world, but its products, packaging, and advertising are tailored to different markets. Squid is a popular topping in Asia. Companies tailor products not only for different countries but also for different customers in different countries. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble’s China division now offers products designed for different local market segments in that country. P&amp;G has an advanced formulation of laundry detergent for the premium segment, a modified product for the second (economy) segment, and a very basic, inexpensive product created for the third (rural) segment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_033">Dan Sewell, “P&amp;G May Make Changes as it Faces Challenges,” <em class="emphasis">The Associated Press</em>, June 9, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p04">Sellers are increasingly targeting consumers in China, Russia, India, and Brazil because of their fast-growing middle classes. Take the cosmetics maker Avon. Avon’s largest market is no longer the United States. It is Brazil. Brazilians are extremely looks-conscious and increasingly able to afford cosmetic products as well as plastic surgery.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_034">Jonathan Wheatley, “Business of Beauty Is Turning Heads in Brazil,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, January 20, 2010, 5.</span> So attractive are these countries that firms are changing how they develop goods and services, too. “Historically, American companies innovated in the U.S. and took those products abroad,” says Vjay Govindarahan, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. Now, says Govindarahan, companies are creating low-cost products to capture large markets in developing countries and then selling them in developed countries. Acer’s $250 laptop and General Electric’s ultrainexpensive $1,000 electrocardiogram device are examples. The world’s cheapest car, the $2,500 Tata Nano, was developed for India but is slated to be sold in the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_035">Daniel, McGinn, “Cheap, Cheap, Cheap,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, February 2010, 10.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p05">Other strategies for targeting markets abroad include acquiring (buying) foreign companies or companies with large market shares there. To tap the Indian market, Kraft made a bid to buy the candymaker Cadbury, which controls about one-third of India’s chocolate market. Likewise, to compete against Corona beer, the Dutch brewer Heineken recently purchased Mexico’s Femsa, which makes the beer brands Dos Equis, Tecate, and Sol.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_036">Michael J. de la Merced and Chris V. Nicholson, “Heineken in Deal to Buy Big Mexican Brewer,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 11, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/business/global/12beer.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/business/global/12beer.html</a> (accessed January 26, 2010).</span> However, some countries don’t allow foreign firms to buy domestic firms. They can only form partnerships with them. Other regulatory and cultural barriers sometimes prevent foreign firms from “invading” a country. IKEA, the Swedish home-furnishings maker, eventually left Russia because it found it too hard to do business there. By contrast, McDonald’s efforts to expand into Russia have been quite successful. Having saturated other markets, the hamburger chain is hoping to continue to grow by opening hundreds of new stores in the country.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-133234-ch05_s03_s05_p06">A market worth targeting has the following characteristics: (1) It’s sizeable enough to be profitable, given your operating costs; (2) it’s growing; (3) it’s not already swamped by competitors, or you have found a way to stand out in the crowd; (4) it’s accessible, or you can find a way to reach it; (5) you have the resources to compete in it; and (6) it “fits in” with your firm’s mission and objectives. Most firms tailor their offerings in one way or another to meet the needs of different segments of customers. A multisegment marketing strategy can allow a company to respond to demographic and other changes in markets, including economic downturns. Concentrated marketing involves targeting a very select group of customers. Niche marketing involves targeting an even more select group of consumers. Microtargeting, or <em class="emphasis">narrowcasting</em>, is a new, effort to “super target” consumers by gathering all kinds of data available on people—everything from their tax and phone records to the catalogs they receive. Firms that compete in the global marketplace can use any combination of these segmenting strategies or none at all. Sellers are increasingly targeting consumers in China, Russia, India, and Brazil because of their fast-growing middle classes.

            <li>Staples and The Limited have attempted to thwart shoppers who abuse store return policies. When a customer returns items, store clerks swipe the customer’s driver’s license through electronic card readers that track buying and return patterns for any suspicious activity.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn05_040">Liz Pulliam Weston, “The Basics: Are You a Bad Customer?” <em class="emphasis">MSN Money</em>.</span> What drawbacks do you think such a strategy could have?</li>
            <li>Is it always harder to find new customers than it is to retain old ones or does it depend on the business you’re in?</li>
            <li>Does one-to-one marketing have to be expensive? How can small organizations interact with their customers in a cost-effective way?</li>
            <li>Are large companies better off using multisegment strategies and small companies better off using niche strategies? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How have companies such as JCPenney and Sears tried to change their position (reposition their stores)?</li>
            <li>Do you think hotel companies have segmented the market too much and confused customers?</li>

Do you think the video is far-fetched? Or do you think consumers should be alarmed? In your opinion, do the potential benefits of CRM databases exceed the potential downsides—or not?</li>
            <li>Form groups of three students. Think of a product or service that one of you purchased recently on campus. How might you go about developing a customer profile for the product? List the sources you would use.</li>
            <li>Describe a product you like that you believe more people should use. As a marketer, how would you reposition the product to increase its use? Outline your strategy.</li>
            <li>Look at the latest census data and identify at least two areas of the country that are growing. What type of businesses would you recommend enter the growing markets?</li>
            <li>Think of an idea for a new product or service. Who would be the target market(s) and how would you position your offering?</li>
