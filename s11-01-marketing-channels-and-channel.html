    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p01">Today, marketing channel decisions are as important as the decisions companies make about the features and prices of products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_001">Randy Littleson, “Supply Chain Trends: What’s In, What’s Out,” <em class="emphasis">Manufacturing.net</em>, February 6, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.manufacturing.net/articles/2007/02/supply-chain-trends-whats-in-whats-out">http://www.manufacturing.net/articles/2007/02/supply-chain-trends-whats-in-whats-out</a> (accessed April 13, 2012).</span> Consumers have become more demanding. They are used to getting what they want. If you can’t get your product to them when, where, and how they want it, they will simply buy a competing product. In other words, <em class="emphasis">how</em> companies sell has become as important as <em class="emphasis">what</em> they sell.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_002">“Developing a Channel Strategy,” <em class="emphasis">CBSNews.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51168339/developing-a-channel-strategy/?tag=mncol;lst;1">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51168339/developing-a-channel-strategy/?tag=mncol;lst;1</a> (accessed April 13, 2012).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p02">The firms a company partners with to actively promote and sell a product as it travels through its marketing channel to users are referred to by the firm as its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">channel members</a><span class="glossdef">The firms a company partners with to actively promote and sell a product as it travels through its marketing channel to users.</span></span> (or partners). Companies strive to choose not only the best marketing channels but also the best channel partners. A strong channel partner like Walmart can promote and sell the heck out of a product that might not otherwise turn a profit for its producer. In turn, Walmart wants to work with strong channel partners it can depend on to continuously provide it with great products that fly off the shelves. By contrast, a weak channel partner can be a liability.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p03">The simplest marketing channel consists of just two parties—a producer and a consumer. Your haircut is a good example. When you get a haircut, it travels straight from your hairdresser to you. No one else owns, handles, or remarkets the haircut to you before you get it. However, many other products and services pass through multiple organizations before they get to you. These organizations are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intermediaries</a><span class="glossdef">Third parties that facilitate the supply and sale of products from manufacturers to users.</span></span> (or <em class="emphasis">middlemen</em> or <em class="emphasis">resellers</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p04">Companies partner with intermediaries not because they necessarily want to (ideally they could sell their products straight to users) but because the intermediaries can help them sell the products better than they could working alone. In other words, they have some sort of capabilities the producer needs: contact with many customers or the right customers, marketing expertise, shipping and handling capabilities, and the ability to lend the producer credit are among the types of help a firm can get by utilizing a channel partner. There are four forms of utility, or value, that channels offer. These are time, form, place, and ownership.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p05">Intermediaries also create efficiencies by streamlining the number of transactions an organization must make, each of which takes time and costs money to conduct. As <a class="xref" href="#fwk-133234-ch08_s01_f01">Figure 8.1 "Using Intermediaries to Streamline the Number of Transactions"</a> shows, by selling the tractors it makes through local farm machinery dealers, the farm machinery manufacturer John Deere can streamline the number of transactions it makes from eight to just two.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p06">The marketing environment is always changing, so what was a great channel or channel partner yesterday might not be a great channel partner today. Changes in technology, production techniques, and your customer’s needs mean you have to continually reevaluate your marketing channels and the channel partners you ally yourself with. Moreover, when you create a new product, you can’t assume the channels that were used in the past are the best ones.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_003">Geoff Lancaster and Frank Withey, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Fundamentals</em> (Burlington, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann, 2007), 173.</span> A different channel or channel partner might be better.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p07">Consider Microsoft’s digital encyclopedia, Encarta, which was first sold on CD and via online subscription in the early 1990s. Encarta nearly destroyed Encyclopedia Britannica, a firm that had dominated the print encyclopedia business for literally centuries. Ironically, Microsoft had actually tried to partner with Encyclopedia Britannica to use its encyclopedia information to make Encarta but was turned down.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_p08">But today, Encarta no longer exists. It’s been put out of business by the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. The point is that products and their marketing channels are constantly evolving. Consequently, you and your company have to be ready to evolve, too.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Marketing Channels versus Supply Chains</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s02_p01">In the past few decades, organizations have begun taking a more holistic look at their marketing channels. Instead of looking at only the firms that sell and promote their products, they have begun looking at <em class="emphasis">all</em> the organizations that figure into any part of the process of producing, promoting, and delivering an offering to its user. All these organizations are considered part of the offering’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supply chain</a><span class="glossdef">All the organizations that participate in the production, promotion, and delivery of a product or service from the producer to the end consumer.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s02_p02">For instance, the supply chain includes producers of the raw materials that go into a product. If it’s a food product, the supply chain extends back through the distributors all the way to the farmers who grew the ingredients and the companies from which the farmers purchased the seeds, fertilizer, or animals. A product’s supply chain also includes transportation companies such as railroads that help physically move the product and companies that build Web sites for other companies. If a software maker hires a company in India to help it write a computer program, the Indian company is part of the partner’s supply chain. These types of firms aren’t considered channel partners because it’s not their job to actively sell the products being produced. Nonetheless, they all contribute to a product’s success or failure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s02_p03">Firms are constantly monitoring their supply chains and tinkering with them so they’re as efficient as possible. This process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supply chain management</a><span class="glossdef">The process of managing and refining supply chains so as to make them as efficient as possible.</span></span>. Supply chain management is challenging. If done well, it’s practically an art.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Channel Partners</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Let’s now look at the basic types of channel partners. To help you understand the various types of channel partners, we will go over the most common types of intermediaries. The two types you hear about most frequently are wholesalers and retailers. Keep in mind, however, that the categories we discuss in this section are just that—categories. In recent years, the lines between wholesalers, retailers, and producers have begun to blur considerably. Microsoft is a producer of goods, but recently it began opening up its own retail stores to sell products to consumers, much as Apple has done.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_004">Daniel Lyons, “The Lost Decade,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, November 9, 2009, 27.</span> As you will learn later in the chapter, Walmart and other large retailers now produce their own store brands and sell them to other retailers. Similarly, many producers have outsourced their manufacturing, and although they still call themselves manufacturers, they act more like wholesalers. Wherever organizations see an opportunity, they are beginning to take it, regardless of their positions in marketing channels.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Wholesalers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Wholesalers</a><span class="glossdef">Businesses that purchase products in large quantities, can store the products, can break the pallets down into cases or units, and can deliver the desired quantity of a product to distributors, retailers, and/or consumers.</span></span> obtain large quantities of products from producers, store them, and break them down into cases and other smaller units more convenient for retailers to buy, a process called “breaking bulk.” Wholesalers get their name from the fact that they resell goods “whole” to other companies without transforming the goods. If you are trying to stock a small electronics store, you probably don’t want to purchase a truckload of iPods. Instead, you probably want to buy a smaller assortment of iPods as well as other merchandise. Via wholesalers, you can get the assortment of products you want in the quantities you want. Some wholesalers carry a wide range of different products. Other carry narrow ranges of products.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p02">Most wholesalers “take title” to goods—or own them until purchased by other sellers. Wholesalers such as these assume a great deal of risk on the part of companies further down the marketing channel as a result. For example, if the iPods you plan to purchase are stolen during shipment, damaged, or become outdated because a new model has been released, the wholesaler suffers the loss—not you. Electronic products, in particular, become obsolete very quickly. Think about the cell phone you owned just a couple of years ago. Would you want to have to use it today?</p>

                <p class="para">Good thing you don’t have to use the cell phone shown in this YouTube video. You could forget about putting it in your purse or pocket. But in 1973, the phone was the latest and greatest of gadgets. Martin Cooper, who championed the development of the device, was a lead engineer at Motorola. To whom do you think Cooper made his first phone call on the device? To his rivals at AT&amp;T, which at the time manufactured only “landline” phones. He wanted to let them know he and Motorola had changed the telephone game.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p03">There are many types of wholesalers. The three basic types of wholesalers are merchant wholesalers, brokers, and manufacturers’ agents, each of which we discuss next.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Merchant Wholesalers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Merchant wholesalers</a><span class="glossdef">Wholesalers that take title to the goods.</span></span> are wholesalers that take title to the goods. They are also sometimes referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">distributors</a><span class="glossdef">Businesses that purchase large quantities of products, can store products, can sell products, can deliver desired quantities of products, and can offer services. Distributors generally take title to products and employ a sales force to actively market their products.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">dealers</em>, and <em class="emphasis">jobbers</em>. The category includes both full-service wholesalers and limited-service wholesalers. Full-service wholesalers perform a broad range of services for their customers, such as stocking inventories, operating warehouses, supplying credit to buyers, employing salespeople to assist customers, and delivering goods to customers. Maurice Sporting Goods is a large North American full-service wholesaler of hunting and fishing equipment. The firm’s services include helping customers figure out which products to stock, how to price them, and how to display them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_005">“Developing a Channel Strategy,” <em class="emphasis">CBSNews.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51168339/developing-a-channel-strategy/?tag=mncol;lst;1">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-51168339/developing-a-channel-strategy/?tag=mncol;lst;1</a> (accessed April 13, 2012).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Limited-service wholesalers</em> offer fewer services to their customers but lower prices. They might not offer delivery services, extend their customers’ credit, or have sales forces that actively call sellers. <em class="emphasis">Cash-and-carry wholesalers</em> are an example. Small retailers often buy from cash-and-carry wholesalers to keep their prices as low as big retailers that get large discounts because of the huge volumes of goods they buy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Drop shippers</em> are another type of limited-service wholesaler. Although drop shippers take title to the goods, they don’t actually take possession of them or handle them, oftentimes because they deal with goods that are large or bulky. Instead, they earn a commission by finding sellers and passing their orders along to producers, who then ship them directly to the sellers. <em class="emphasis">Mail-order wholesalers</em> sell their products using catalogs instead of sales forces and then ship the products to buyers. <em class="emphasis">Truck jobbers</em> (or <em class="emphasis">truck wholesalers</em>) actually store products, which are often highly perishable (e.g., fresh fish), on their trucks. The trucks make the rounds to customers, who inspect and select the products they want straight off the trucks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Rack jobbers</em> sell specialty products, such as books, hosiery, and magazines that they display on their own racks in stores. Rack jobbers retain the title to the goods while the merchandise is in the stores for sale. Periodically, they take count of what’s been sold off their racks and then bill the stores for those items.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Brokers</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Brokers</a><span class="glossdef">Representatives of one or more manufacturers who sell products on their behalf to consumers, wholesalers, and distributors but do not take title to them.</span></span>, or <em class="emphasis">agents</em>, don’t purchase or take title to the products they sell. Their role is limited to negotiating sales contracts for producers. Clothing, furniture, food, and commodities such as lumber and steel are often sold by brokers. They are generally paid a commission for what they sell and are assigned to different geographical territories by the producers with whom they work. Because they have excellent industry contacts, brokers and agents are “go-to” resources for both consumers and companies trying to buy and sell products.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s03_p02">The most common form of agent and broker consumers encounter are in real estate. A real estate agent represents, or acts for, either the buyer or the seller. The listing agent is contacted by the homeowner who wants to sell, and puts the house on the market. The buyer also contacts an agent who shows the buyer a number of houses. If there is a house that the buyer wants to purchase, the agent calls the listing agent and the price is negotiated. In some states, the buyer’s agent is a legal representative of the seller, unless a buyer’s agent agreement is signed, which is something to keep in mind when you are the buyer. Agents work for brokers, who act as sort of a head agent and market the company’s services while making sure that all of the legal requirements are met.</p>

Retailers vary by the types of products they sell, their sizes, the prices they charge, the level of service they provide consumers, and the convenience or speed they offer. You are familiar with many of these types of retailers because you have purchased products from them. We mentioned Nike and Apple as examples of companies that make and sell products directly to consumers, but in reality, Nike and Apple contract manufacturing to other companies. They may design the products, but they actually buy the finished goods from others.</p>

These were discount retailers that operated under the brand name of a single manufacturer, selling products that couldn’t be sold through normal retail channels due to mistakes made in manufacturing. Often located in rural areas but along interstate highways, these stores had lower overhead than similar stores in big cities due to lower rent and lower employee salaries. But due to the high popularity of the stores, demand far outstripped the supply of mistakes. Most outlet malls are now selling first-quality products only, perhaps at a discount.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-133234-ch08_s01_s01_s05_p08">A new type of retail store that turned up in the last few years is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pop-up store</a><span class="glossdef">Small temporary stores designed to generate “buzz” for a retailer and drive customers to its regular stores.</span></span>. Pop-up stores are small temporary stores. They can be kiosks or temporarily occupy unused retail space. The goal is to create excitement and “buzz” for a retailer that then drives customers to their regular stores. In 2006, JCPenney created a pop-up store in Times Square for a month. Kate Coultas, a spokesperson for JCPenney, said the store got the attention of Manhattan’s residents. Many hadn’t been to a JCPenney store in a long time. “It was a real dramatic statement,” Coultas says. “It kind of had a halo effect” on the company’s stores in the surrounding boroughs of New York City.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-tanner-fn08_006">John Austin, “Pop-Up Stores Offer Long-Term Strategy,” <em class="emphasis">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, November 27, 2009, 1C–2C.</span> Most commonly, though, pop-up stores are used for seasonal sales, such as a costume store before Halloween or the Hillshire Farms sausage and cheese shops you see at the mall just before Christmas.</p>

Marketing channel decisions are as important as the decisions companies make about the features and prices of products. Channel partners are firms that actively promote and sell a product as it travels through its channel to its user. Companies try to choose the best channels and channel partners to help them sell products because doing so can give them a competitive advantage.</p>
